The effect of copepod community structure, feeding behavior, and diel vertical migration (DVM) on fecal pellet carbon flux was investigated using an agent-based model, which was applied to two contrasting open ocean regions: an oligotrophic (Hawaii Ocean Time-series site ALOHA) and a mesotrophic (Japanese time-series site K2) system. Data from the VERtical Transport in the Global Ocean (VERTIGO) project was used to parameterize the model, and modelled fecal pellet fluxes were compared to field-derived neutrally buoyant sediment trap data to examine how community structure and DVM impact fecal pellet carbon flux in the water column. The model produces copepod fecal pellet fluxes that are consistent with sediment trap data from K2 and ALOHA and with other modeling studies. The vertical distribution of copepods matching nighttime field data resulted in a greater magnitude of fecal pellet flux at all model depths compared to daytime distributions. Communities dominated by omnivores resulted in higher fecal pellet carbon flux and lower POC attenuation than those dominated by carnivores or detritivores. Incorporating DVM into the simulations produced lower fecal pellet fluxes in some cases, while also marginally improving the agreement between the modeled and observed median fecal pellet fluxes. The relatively simplified model presented here shows that an agent-based model that uses trait-based relationships for physiological rates can be used to give insight into the variability of particle flux in the deep ocean. © 2022"

A model of the evolutionary dynamics of a community consisting of local (indigenous) and external (migrants) populations interacting in an artificial socioeconomic system is proposed, in which the key sectors of the economy are identified: the extraction of raw materials (primary sector, attracting mainly migrants), the manufacturing sector (secondary sector attracting predominantly indigenous people), and low-tech and high-tech services (tertiary and quaternary sectors of the economy attracting migrants and indigenous people, respectively). The formation of jobs in these sectors of the economy is carried out centrally using the previously proposed fuzzy clustering algorithm. Simulation experiments are carried out, and the effects of segregation due to the desire of agents to search for the most desirable jobs in a bounded neighborhood under various scenario conditions are studied. Using the proposed genetic algorithm, an important optimization problem is solved to maximize GDP growth rates and minimize the level of the population’s segregation. © 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

Worldwide, land-based environmental conservation efforts and agricultural preservation regulations are often concurrent. Complex social-ecological feedback within the coupled natural and human systems nevertheless confounds their effects. Drawing on population-level data for a township encompassed by a national nature reserve, this study applies a spatially explicit agent-based model to understand human-environment interrelationships with household land-use decisions about cropland abandonment restricted by the agricultural preservation rule. Results show that labor migration and cropland abandonment involve feedback loops that exhibit nonlinear effects. The availability of household labor and the amount of cultivated land mediate these effects. The land-use decisions of the farm households are sensitive to the relaxation of the abandonment restriction. The prevalence of cropland abandonment in extent and size increases prominently as the restriction rule begins to relax. The model shows a clearly emerging spatial pattern of an increasing likelihood of cropland abandonment with the relaxed restriction. Abandonment is more likely on dryland parcels and parcels at higher elevations, steeper slopes, and in proximity to forest areas. The shifted distributions of cropland parcels by their biophysical and geographical features from the baseline scenario (full restriction) to the experimental scenario (complete relaxation) also demonstrate these trends. Targeting cropland parcels bearing high risks of abandonment can improve the cost-effectiveness of implementing forest restoration policies while prioritizing those with low risks for agricultural stabilization. The agent-based model is useful for explaining the underlying drivers of land change involving human decision-making. It also suggests implications for balancing trade-offs between environmental conservation and agricultural production. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

The actin cytoskeleton undergoes significant reorganization in many different contexts, including during directed cell migration and over the course of the cell cycle, when cortical actin can transition between different configurations such as open patched meshworks, homogeneous distributions, and aligned bundles. Several types of myosin motor proteins, characterized by different kinetic parameters, have been involved in this reorganization of actin filaments. Given the limitations in studying the interactions of actin with myosin in vivo, we propose stochastic agent-based models and develop a set of data analysis measures to assess how myosin motor proteins mediate various actin organizations. In particular, we identify individual motor parameters, such as motor binding rate and step size, that generate actin networks with different levels of contractility and different patterns of myosin motor localization, which have previously been observed experimentally. In simulations where two motor populations with distinct kinetic parameters interact with the same actin network, we find that motors may act in a complementary way, by tuning the actin network organization, or in an antagonistic way, where one motor emerges as dominant. This modeling and data analysis framework also uncovers parameter regimes where spatial segregation between motor populations is achieved. By allowing for changes in kinetic rates during the actin-myosin dynamic simulations, our work suggests that certain actin-myosin organizations may require additional regulation beyond mediation by motor proteins in order to reconfigure the cytoskeleton network on experimentally-observed timescales.

Our aim is to study the tumour heterogeneity due to the geometry of a growing tumour caused by the phenotypic transformations of cells. In this context, an early vascular growth is considered after angiogenesis. Hence, the microenvironment of the solid tumour is rich of oxygen and nutrients. It is also considered that epidermal growth factor (EGF) is distributed into the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) of the tumour. The developed multi-layered model consists of three layers: intracellular or subcellular, cellular, and extracellular or tissue layer. The model integrates the events that occur simultaneously in these three layers to identify the underlying diversity. Here, every cell is represented as an agent. Characteristics of an agent are controlled by its intracellular protein expressions and its surrounding microenvironment. A mature proliferative or migratory or hybrid cell agent spawn two indistinguishable children unless it may convert into other phenotype due to influence of the microenvironment. Further, a simple cell cycle model is adapted which is influenced by EGF-EGFR signalling pathway and the external oxygen and nutrients. Moreover, migratory and hybrid cells secrete several matrix degrading enzymes (MDEs) which remodel the ECM for tumour invasion locally. Several biomechanical forces are considered that simultaneously act on the cancer cells. The outcome of the model is very similar to the results reported in earlier studies. The model shows the characteristics of cancer invasion that include sustainable proliferation by ignoring growth suppressor signals and reproduction of cancer cells at abnormal proportion, restrict apoptosis, and invade into the surrounding tissue. As the simulation parameters get modified due to different biochemical and biophysical processes, the robustness of the model is determined. It is found that only a number of proliferative cells are moderately sensitive to the parameters and others are less-sensitive.

The risk to golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) is of particular concern due to their small population size and conservation status. Golden eagles subsidize their flight in part by soaring in orographic updrafts, which can place them in conflict with wind turbines utilizing the same low-altitude wind resource. Understanding the behavior of soaring raptors in varying atmospheric conditions can therefore be relevant to predicting and mitigating their risk of collision. We present a predictive movement model that simulates individual paths of golden eagles during directional flight (such as migration) that is subsidized by orographic updraft. We modeled eagles in a 50 km by 50 km study area in Wyoming containing three wind power plants with documented golden eagle collisions with turbines. The movement model is applicable to any region where ground elevation is known at turbine scale (<50 m) and wind conditions are known at facility scale (<3 km). For a given set of atmospheric conditions, the model simulates movements of thousands of orographic soaring eagles to produce a density map quantifying the relative probability of eagle presence. We validated the simulated tracks with GPS telemetry data showing four directional tracks made by golden eagles transiting through the area in 2019 and 2020. For each eagle track, validation was performed using the ratio of the model-simulated eagle presence likelihood with uniform eagle presence and the presence computed using directed random-walk movements. We found that the predictive performance of the model was significantly better (likelihood ratio >1) for low-altitude movements than high-altitude movements that can involve thermal-soaring. We employed the model to produce seasonal presence maps for migrating golden eagles. We found significant turbine-level variations in eagle presence between northerly and southerly migration routes through the study area. Overall, the proposed model offers a generalizable, probabilistic, and predictive tool to assist wind energy developers, ecologists, wildlife managers, and industry consultants in estimating the potential for conflict between soaring birds and wind turbines, thereby reducing the need for site-specific data on golden eagle movements. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."

In this study, an agent-based model is developed to understand the dynamics of such emigration. We hypothesize that skilled people's emigration decisions are based on several factors including the overall economic and social difference between the home and host countries, people's ability and capacity to obtain good jobs and start a life abroad, and the barriers of moving abroad. Furthermore, the social network of individuals also plays a significant role. The model is validated using qualitative and quantitative pattern matching with real-world observations. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses are performed in addition to several scenario analyses. Linear and random forest response surface models are created to provide quick predictions on the number of emigrants and to understand the effect sizes of individual parameters. Overall, this study provides an abstract model where brain drain dynamics can be explored. Findings from the simulation outputs show that the future socioeconomic state of the country is more important than the current state, lack of barriers results in a large number of emigrants, and network effects ensure compounding effects on emigration. Upon further development and customization, future versions can assist in the decision-making of social policymakers regarding brain drain. © 2014 IEEE."

We show that a female-limited polymorphism in dorsal patterning (diamond/chevron) in the brown anole is controlled by a single Mendelian locus. This locus contains the gene CCDC170 that is adjacent to, and coexpressed with, the Estrogen receptor-1 gene, explaining why the polymorphism is female limited. CCDC170 is an organizer of the Golgi-microtubule network underlying a cell's ability to migrate, and the two segregating alleles encode structurally different proteins. Our agent-based modeling of skin development demonstrates that, in principle, a change in cell migratory behaviors is sufficient to switch between the two morphs. These results suggest that CCDC170 might have been co-opted as a switch between color patterning morphs, likely by modulating cell migratory behaviors. Copyright © 2022 The Authors"

A Fast Screening Tool To De‐Risk Hydrocarbon Prospects,2022,Energies,"Institute of GeoEnergy Engineering (IGE), Heriot‐Watt University, Edinburgh, EH14 4AS, United Kingdom; Studio X LLC, Austin, TX  78702, United States","Understanding subsurface hydrocarbon migration is a crucial task for petroleum geosci-entists. Hydrocarbons are released from deeply buried and heated source rocks, such as shales with a high organic content. They then migrate upwards through the overlying lithologies. Some hydrocarbon becomes trapped in suitable geological structures that, over a geological timescale, produce viable hydrocarbon reservoirs. This work investigates how intelligent agent models can mimic these complex natural subsurface processes and account for geological uncertainty. Phys-ics‐based approaches are commonly used in petroleum system modelling and flow simulation software to identify migration pathways from source rocks to traps. However, the problem with these simulations is that they are computationally demanding, making them infeasible for exten-sive uncertainty quantification. In this work, we present a novel dynamic screening tool for secondary hydrocarbon migration that relies on agent‐based modelling. It is fast and is therefore suitable for uncertainty quantification, before using petroleum system modelling software for a more accurate evaluation of migration scenarios. We first illustrate how interacting but independent agents can mimic the movement of hydrocarbon molecules using a few simple rules by focusing on the main drivers of migration: buoyancy and capillary forces. Then, using a synthetic case study, we validate the usefulness of the agent modelling approach to quantify the impact of geological parameter uncertainty (e.g., fault transmissibility, source rock location, expulsion rate) on potential hydrocarbon accumulations and migrations pathways, an essential task to enable quick de‐risking of a likely prospect. © 2022 by the authors.

Additive manufacturing (AM) presents an opportunity to manufacture affordable patient-specific implants. Optimization of the implant–bone interface to maximize osseointegration (bone ingrowth) has not been appropriately addressed. Mechanobiological models, suited to predict mechanical adaptation of bone, cannot be used to predict osseointegration inside implants as the implant is not exposed to any mechanical loading until it is fully accepted by the host body. Biological models relying on partial differential equations based on continuum approximation are not well-suited to predict the discrete phenomenon of osseointegration. This study proposes an agent-based modeling (ABM) approach for representing the osseointegration process for orthopedic implants produced by powder-bed additive manufacturing processes. Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) is a cellular automata based discrete computing technique that uses rule-based mathematics derived from experimental studies to simulate evolutionary phenomena. In this paper, osseointegration inside a hexagonal closed packing of AM powder particles is modeled using ABM. Cellular agents such as pre-osteoblasts and osteoblasts are realistically modeled as cubic cells. The proposed model underpredicts osseointegration at early stages but predicts osseointegration at around 21 days with sufficient accuracy when compared to the in vitro test conducted by Xue et al. in 2007. © 2021"

This approach is based on the previously developed simulation model of interaction between two communities: migrants and natives that is implemented in the AnyLogic simulation software. The model has had a low dimensionality of the discrete space representing the operating environment of the agent populations and a deterministic decision-making system of each agent. At the same time, the presence of multiple interactions between agents and transitions between their states determines a high computational complexity of such a model. The use of FLAME GPU makes it possible to conduct extensive simulation experiments with the model, mainly due to the parallelization of computational processes at the level of each agent, as well as the implementation of the mechanism of multiple computations using Monte Carlo techniques. The developed framework is used to study the impact of the most important parameters of the model (e.g., rate of migration, governmental expenditures on integration, frequency of creation of new workplaces, etc.) on the key outputs of the modeled socio-economic system (in particular, population size, share of migrants, number of assimilated migrants, GDP growth rate, etc.).

Although there have been many studies evaluating the effects of telecouplings, telecouplings in those studies were often investigated separately, and how telecouplings may interact and affect dynamics of rural coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) jointly was rarely evaluated. In this study, we developed an agent-based model and simulated the impacts of two globally common telecouplings, nature-based tourism and labor migration, on forest dynamics of a rural CHANS, China’s Wolong Nature Reserve (Wolong). Nature-based tourism and labor migration can facilitate forest recovery, and the predicted forest areas in Wolong in 2030 would be reduced by 26.2 km2 (6.8%) and 23.9 km2 (6.2%), respectively, without their effects. However, tourism development can significantly reduce the probability of local households to have member(s) outmigrate to work in cities and decrease the positive impact of labor migration on forest recovery. Our simulations show that the interaction between tourism and labor migration can reduce the potential forest recovery by 3.5 km2 (5.0%) in 2030.

This is because NSCs can circumvent the blood-brain barrier and migrate to areas of damage in the central nervous system, including tumors, stroke, and wound injuries. However, for successful clinical application of NSC treatment, a sufficient number of viable cells must reach the diseased or damaged area(s) in the brain, and evidence suggests that it may be affected by the paths the NSCs take through the brain, as well as the locations of tumors. To study the NSC migration in brain, we develop a mathematical model of therapeutic NSC migration towards brain tumor, that provides a low cost platform to investigate NSC treatment efficacy. Our model is an extension of the model developed in Rockne et al. (PLoS ONE 13, e0199967, 2018) that considers NSC migration in non-tumor bearing naive mouse brain. Here we modify the model in Rockne et al. in three ways: (i) we consider three-dimensional mouse brain geometry, (ii) we add chemotaxis to model the tumor-tropic nature of NSCs into tumor sites, and (iii) we model stochasticity of migration speed and chemosensitivity. The proposed model is used to study migration patterns of NSCs to sites of tumors for different injection strategies, in particular, intranasal and intracerebral delivery. We observe that intracerebral injection results in more NSCs arriving at the tumor site(s), but the relative fraction of NSCs depends on the location of injection relative to the target site(s). On the other hand, intranasal injection results in fewer NSCs at the tumor site, but yields a more even distribution of NSCs within and around the target tumor site(s). © 2022 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press."

A current phenomena is short-term rentals of private homes. In its peer-to-peer form, this phenomena has grown sharply, facilitated by services such as Airbnb. Its growth has caused controversies among communities in touristic areas of Amsterdam, since it contributes to a changed social fabric, increased housing prices and overall gentrification. In the Netherlands and elsewhere, municipal and national policy makers are interested to regulate short-term rentals. In order to provide insights into qualitative policy effects, we develop a micro-level agent-based simulation. Our spatial model simulates residential migration based on income and house pricing. The underlying economic theory is that of Smith’s rent-gap hypothesis. Our model is among the first agent-based approaches investigating this type of rental market, and the first to model a specific housing market, including social housing, in a geographically accurate way. Simulation analysis shows that the touristic rental market has caused considerable changes in housing prices and population development. We find that more lower income citizens remain in the city centre when regulation of the market is stronger, and that banning the touristic market restrains the overall increase in house prices, compared to the business-as-usual scenario. However, the feasibility of enforcement of regulation, and its libertarian consequences, must be considered. © The Author(s) 2021."

Mathematical biology seeks to explain biophysical processes in mathematical terms at, and across, all relevant spatial and temporal scales, through the generation of representative models. While non-spatial, ordinary differential equation (ODE) models are often used and readily calibrated to experimental data, they do not explicitly represent the spatial and stochastic features of a biological system, limiting their insights and applications. However, spatial models describing biological systems with spatial information are mathematically complex and computationally expensive, which limits the ability to calibrate and deploy them and highlights the need for simpler methods able to model the spatial features of biological systems. Results: In this work, we develop a formal method for deriving cell-based, spatial, multicellular models from ODE models of population dynamics in biological systems, and vice versa. We provide examples of generating spatiotemporal, multicellular models from ODE models of viral infection and immune response. In these models, the determinants of agreement of spatial and non-spatial models are the degree of spatial heterogeneity in viral production and rates of extracellular viral diffusion and decay. We show how ODE model parameters can implicitly represent spatial parameters, and cell-based spatial models can generate uncertain predictions through sensitivity to stochastic cellular events, which is not a feature of ODE models. Using our method, we can test ODE models in a multicellular, spatial context and translate information to and from non-spatial and spatial models, which help to employ spatiotemporal multicellular models using calibrated ODE model parameters. We additionally investigate objects and processes implicitly represented by ODE model terms and parameters and improve the reproducibility of spatial, stochastic models. Conclusion: We developed and demonstrate a method for generating spatiotemporal, multicellular models from non-spatial population dynamics models of multicellular systems. We envision employing our method to generate new ODE model terms from spatiotemporal and multicellular models, recast popular ODE models on a cellular basis, and generate better models for critical applications where spatial and stochastic features affect outcomes. © 2021, The Author(s)."

In large protected North American areas such as Yellowstone and Wood Buffalo National Parks, aquatic habitats are disappearing and wetland-dependent fauna are in decline1–3. Here we investigate population dynamics of an indicator species in Canada’s Peace-Athabasca Delta (“the delta”), a World Heritage Site. Based on population surveys, habitat mapping and genetic data from 288 muskrats, we use agent-based modeling and genetic analyses to explain population expansion and decline of the semi-aquatic muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus). Simulations quantify a large population (~500,000 individuals) following flood-induced habitat gains, with decreased size (~10,000 individuals) during drying. Genetic analyses show extremely low long-term effective population size (Ne: 60–127), supporting a legacy of population bottlenecks. Our simulations indicate that the muskrat population in the delta is a metapopulation with individuals migrating preferentially along riparian pathways. Related individuals found over 40 km apart imply dispersal distances far greater than their typical home range (130 m). Rapid metapopulation recovery is achieved via riparian corridor migration and passive flood-transport of individuals. Source-sink dynamics show wetland loss impacts on the muskrat metapopulation’s spatial extent.

We aim to explore mechanisms and develop scenarios, which are going to be validated through further research. We use a model of a simple pastoralist society in a world without borders to migration by adding the possibility of experiencing the effects of social structures (such as family and friends) and technological networks (e.g., social media). It appears obvious that pastoralist mobility depends on other dimensions as land tenure and traditional knowledge; however, isolating these two effects and experimenting in a simple society allow us to filter the multidimensionality of mobility decisions and concentrate on comparing scenarios in several different social structures and technological network combinations. The results show an expected behavior of more connection and more mobility, and a non-linear emergent behavior where pastoralists wait for a longer amount of time to mobilize when they interact using powerful social and technological networks. This occurs until they decide to move, and then, they mobilize more quickly and strongly than they did when communication was non-existent between them.

To test our hypotheses of the importance of management, models can simulate historical conditions and alternative management scenarios such as flow manipulation and modification of channel geometry. Swimming behaviors in these models are often specified to match aggregated observed properties such as transit time estimated from acoustic telemetry data. In our study, we estimate swimming behaviors at 5 s intervals directly from acoustic telemetry data and concurrent high-resolution three-dimensional hydrodynamic model results at the junction of the San Joaquin River and Old River in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California. We use the swimming speed dataset to specify a stochastic swimming behavior consistent with observations of instantaneous swimming. We then evaluate the effect of individual components of the swimming formulation on predicted route selection and the consistency with observed route selection. The PTM predicted route selection fractions are similar among passive and active swimming behaviors for most tags, but the observed route selection for some tags would be unlikely under passive behavior leading to the conclusion that active swimming behavior influenced the route selection of several tagged smolts. © 2021 by the authors.

The question of how a capacity for adaptive migrations influences the success of a microbial population in various conditions is a challenge addressed in this study. We employed the agent-based model of competition of motile and sedentary microbial populations in a confined aquatic environment supplied with a periodic batch nutrient source to assess the fitness of both. Such factors as nutrient concentration in a batch, batch period, mortality type and energetic costs of migration were considered to determine the conditions favouring different strategies: Nomad of a motile population and Settler of a sedentary one. The modelling results demonstrate that dynamic and nutrient-scarce environments favour motile populations, whereas nutrient-rich and stagnant environments promote sedentary microorganisms. Energetic costs of migration determine whether or not the Nomad strategy of the motile population is successful, though it also depends on such conditions as nutrient availability. Even without penalties for migration, under certain conditions, the sedentary Settler population dominates in the ecosystem. It is achieved by decreasing the local nutrient availability near the nutrient source, as motile populations relying on a local optimizing strategy tend to follow benign conditions and fail, enduring stress associated with crossing the valleys of suboptimal nutrient availability. © 2021 by the authors.

This work focuses on the protection of the agent as well as the information it processes in a distributed environment throughout the network. Mobile agents move between various network-enabled platforms to process the information they manage. To simulate an environment based on the Internet of Things (IoT), a scheme has been presented which details the necessary steps to be carried out by the agent to perform the migration. Today it was proved that there is no infallible solution that guarantees the security of the whole system. However, the importance of security mechanisms to reduce and/or mitigate security threats is fundamental. This work is a study based on a mobile agent-based approach that travels from host to host. A review of different threats to this particular model is presented. Throughout this work a detailed study is presented based on the migration protocol of the agents, which will be determined by using modeling tools such as Microsoft Modeling Tool (MMT) used in this case, to discover and detail each of the threats presented by this protocol. Additionally, an alternative as a solution according to a protocol that runs thanks to the implementation of hardware elements is proposed, which makes use of a TPM, thus determining which threats are mitigated or solved by implementing such hardware in conjunction with the protocol developed for this purpose. © 2021 ACM."

Therefore, this paper assesses literature on water-related human responses, the quantification and conceptualization methods and theories used, the scale at which models are applied, and the extent to which findings are used to make policy recommendations. We found system dynamics approaches mostly applied for policy evaluations, but of-ten with a limited integration of human behavior beyond water use; agent‐based models seem to be suited for policy analysis, but only limitedly applied for that purpose; and statistical studies to present the widest range of human responses and explanatory factors, but without making the behavioral mechanisms explicit.

The changes only affect the Milford Haven Waterway model test case and in particular they mainly affect the discussion around the model results in relation to the numbers of eels entering the outfall of Pembroke Power Station. Specifically, the discussion of the model results did not describe the presence of a high weir structure and strong flows at the outfall. Consequently several modifications have been made to the article, described below. The main modification has been to replace the final paragraph in the results section on page 15. The original short paragraph read as follows: It is noted that a lack of reliable in situ data on eel entrainment at the power station means these modelled entrainment rates cannot yet be confirmed. This has been replaced with: Once the eels reach the outfall it is unlikely that they are able to progress further due to the fast opposing flow speeds and the presence of a high weir. It should also be noted that the modelled rate of eel entrainment in the power station intake is simply a model result based on the assumptions made in this simulation. This rate cannot be verified from available survey data as the monitoring program agreed with the regulator does not target eel specifically. This is because the current eel protection measures at the intake are deemed adequate to prevent harmful entrainment or the impediment of free passage to eel. The abstract on page 1 has also been modified to reflect this change by the slightly modifying two sentences. The first modified sentence originally read as follows: The parameterised model is then used predictively at Milford Haven Waterway to investigate potential impacts on the juvenile eel population due to entrainment in a power plant cooling water intake and outfall. This was edited to include the words ‘attraction to the’ before the final word ‘outfall’ as follows: The parameterised model is then used predictively at Milford Haven Waterway to investigate potential impacts on the juvenile eel population due to entrainment in a power plant cooling water intake and attraction to the outfall. The penultimate sentence in the abstract has also been modified, which originally read: For the Milford Haven case study, the model predicted a juvenile eel intake and outfall entrainment rate of 2.0% and 4.7%, respectively. This has been modified to remove the implication that the eels swim into the outfall, as follows: For the Milford Haven case study, the model predicted a juvenile eel intake entrainment rate of 2.0% with 4.7% predicted to swim to the outfall.

The structure of social networks is measured through the social network analysis with degree and betweenness. Then, we develop an agent-based model to examine how social networks function to affect household livelihood resilience. The model captures feedbacks between PES intervention, social networks, household livelihood decisions, and environmental changes. Results show that the livelihood resilience of rural households is expected to decline during 2013–2030 within the current PES scheme. Social networks impose significant positive impacts on resilience building. However, their effects decay over time due to the fading structure and function of social networks along with massive rural-to-urban migration.

To reduce the risk, critical-sized bone defects are often treated with recombinant human BMP-2. Although enhanced bone tissue formation is observed when BMP-2 is administered locally to the defect, spatial and temporal distribution of callus tissue often differs from that found during regular bone healing or in defects treated differently. How this altered tissue patterning due to BMP-2 treatment is linked to mechano-biological principles at the cellular scale remains largely unknown. In this study, the mechano-biological regulation of BMP-2-treated critical-sized bone defect healing was investigated using a multiphysics multiscale in silico approach. Finite element and agent-based modeling techniques were combined to simulate healing within a critical-sized bone defect (5 mm) in a rat femur. Computer model predictions were compared to in vivo microCT data outcome of bone tissue patterning at 2, 4, and 6 weeks postoperation. In vivo, BMP-2 treatment led to complete healing through periosteal bone bridging already after 2 weeks postoperation. Computer model simulations showed that the BMP-2 specific tissue patterning can be explained by the migration of mesenchymal stromal cells to regions with a specific concentration of BMP-2 (chemotaxis).

We divide a concerned geographic region into several sub-regions based on the local administrative body to recommend a sub-region where augmentation is necessary.

While many experimental studies discussed the role of ECM in individual and collective cell migration, there are still unanswered questions about the impact of nonlocal cell sensing of other cells on the overall shape of tumour aggregation and its migration type. There are also unanswered questions about the migration and spread of tumour that arises at the boundary between different tissues with different collagen fibre orientations. To address these questions, in this study we develop a hybrid multi-scale model that considers the cells as individual entities and ECM as a continuous field. The numerical simulations obtained through this model match experimental observations, confirming that tumour aggregations are not moving if the ECM fibres are distributed randomly, and they only move when the ECM fibres are highly aligned. Moreover, the stationary tumour aggregations can have circular shapes or irregular shapes (with finger-like protrusions), while the moving tumour aggregations have elongate shapes (resembling to clusters, strands or files). We also show that the cell sensing radius impacts tumour shape only when there is a low ratio of fibre to non-fibre ECM components. Finally, we investigate the impact of different ECM fibre orientations corresponding to different tissues, on the overall tumour invasion of these neighbouring tissues. © Copyright © 2021 Suveges, Chamseddine, Rejniak, Eftimie and Trucu."

Collective tissue dynamics—understood as population behaviour arising from the interplay of the constituting discrete cells—can be studied with on- and off-lattice agent-based models. However, classical on-lattice agent-based models, also known as cellular automata, fail to replicate key aspects of collective migration, which is a central instance of collective behaviour in multicellular systems. To overcome drawbacks of classical on-lattice models, we introduce an on-lattice, agent-based modelling class for collective cell migration, which we call biological lattice-gas cellular automaton (BIO-LGCA). The BIO-LGCA is characterised by synchronous time updates, and the explicit consideration of individual cell velocities. While rules in classical cellular automata are typically chosen ad hoc, rules for cell-cell and cell-environment interactions in the BIO-LGCA can also be derived from experimental cell migration data or biophysical laws for individual cell migration. We introduce elementary BIO-LGCA models of fundamental cell interactions, which may be combined in a modular fashion to model complex multicellular phenomena. We exemplify the mathematical mean-field analysis of specific BIO-LGCA models, which allows to explain collective behaviour. The first example predicts the formation of clusters in adhesively interacting cells. The second example is based on a novel BIO-LGCA combining adhesive interactions and alignment.

One hypothesis is that intense warfare between groups favored altruism within groups, a hypothesis given some support by computational modeling and, in particular, the work of Choi and Bowles [J.-K. Choi, S. Bowles, Science 318, 636-640 (2007)]. The results of computational models are, however, sensitive to chosen parameter values and a deeper assessment of the plausibility of the parochial altruism hypothesis requires exploring this model in more detail. Here, I use a recently developed method to reexamine Choi and Bowles' model under a much broader range of conditions to those used in the original paper. Although the evolution of altruism is robust to perturbations in most of the default parameters, it is highly sensitive to group size and migration and to the lethality of war. The results show that the degree of genetic differentiation between groups (FST) produced by Choi and Bowles' original model is much greater than empirical estimates of FST between hunter-gatherer groups. When FST in the model is close to empirically observed values, altruism does not evolve.

This framework is a four-step process, progressing from changes in individual behavior and/or physiology, to changes in individual health, then vital rates, and finally to population-level effects. Despite its simplicity, there are few complete PCoD models available for any marine mammal species due to a lack of data available to parameterize many of the steps. Here, we present an application of the PCoD framework for migrating humpback whales exposed to a simulated commercial seismic survey scenario. We approached the framework in two ways; first, progressing sequentially forwards through the steps and basing our assessment on lactating females. This cohort was considered to be the most vulnerable in terms of energetic costs of disturbance, and most likely to influence any change in population growth due to future breeding success. Field measurements of behavioral responses of migrating humpback whales to seismic air guns from a previous study were used to parameterize an agent-based model (ABM). This ABM was used to estimate the probability of response, where a response was defined as a change in the migratory movement of female-calf pairs, and the duration of any resulting delay in migration. We then estimated the energetic consequences of any delay in migration for the lactating females and created population growth models with which to assess any population-level effects. The results of the forwards approach suggested a low potential for population consequences of seismic surveys on migrating humpbacks. Working backwards through the framework, we investigated “worst case” scenarios that could potentially lead to a population-level effect. Here, we started with increasing calf mortality and assumed that an exposure time greater than 48 h would increase mortality risk. We determined the most likely context in which this exposure would occur (resting area) and then tested this context within an ABM. This backwards approach illustrates how the PCoD model can be used to make management decisions regarding animal populations and exposure to anthropogenic stressors. © Copyright © 2021 Dunlop, Braithwaite, Mortensen and Harris."

Analysis of the model dynamics can be challenging due to their inherent stochasticity and heavy computational requirements. Common approaches to the analysis of agent-based models include extensive Monte Carlo simulation of the model or the derivation of coarse-grained differential equation models to predict the expected or averaged output from the agent-based model. Both of these approaches have limitations, however, as extensive computation of complex agent-based models may be infeasible, and coarse-grained differential equation models can fail to accurately describe model dynamics in certain parameter regimes. We propose that methods from the equation learning field provide a promising, novel and unifying approach for agent-based model analysis. Equation learning is a recent field of research from data science that aims to infer differential equation models directly from data. We use this tutorial to review how methods from equation learning can be used to learn differential equation models from agent-based model simulations. We demonstrate that this framework is easy to use, requires few model simulations, and accurately predicts model dynamics in parameter regions where coarse-grained differential equation models fail to do so. We highlight these advantages through several case studies involving two agent-based models that are broadly applicable to biological phenomena: a birth-death-migration model commonly used to explore cell biology experiments and a susceptible-infected-recovered model of infectious disease spread. © 2021 The Author(s)."

Numerical models, substantiated with data from field and laboratory studies, can potentially predict and quantify the relative impacts of such activities, thereby assisting in the sustainable management of eel populations. Here, we present an agent-based model (ABM) of juvenile eel migration up estuaries. The model includes relevant eel behaviours and environmental conditions that, according to the literature, influence upstream migration. Crucially, by assessing the local salinity gradient and relative flow direction, the modelled eels (agents) self-determine whether the tide is flooding or ebbing and orientate themselves for navigation, with no top-down instructions. This allows the agents to decide which particular behaviour to undertake as part of Selective Tidal Stream Transport (STST). The developed ABM is coupled to a hydrodynamic model of the Thames Estuary and the results substantiated by comparison against eel trap data. Combinations of the various STST behaviours are systematically tested and the influence they have on up-estuary migration is assessed in terms of relative energy expenditure. The parameterised model is then used predictively at Milford Haven Waterway to investigate potential impacts on the juvenile eel population due to entrainment in a power plant cooling water intake and outfall. Results from the Thames model case study indicate that including bed anchoring behaviour is essential for achieving a good comparison with the eel trap data and the choice of salinity detection threshold is also important. If daylight avoidance (diel) behaviour is not included, the most energy efficient migration is achieved using just two STST behaviours (ebb tide bed anchoring and upward migration during flood). With diel behaviour included, energy expenditure is greater, but some efficiency is regained by including all of the STST behaviours. For the Milford Haven case study, the model predicted a juvenile eel intake and outfall entrainment rate of 2.0% and 4.7%, respectively. It is concluded that the ABM is a valuable tool for assessing potential impacts on the recruitment of eels (extendable to other species) and could be used to assist in site-selection and low impact design of energy infrastructure in tidal environments. © 2021 The Authors"

Here we present an agent-based model for simulating the emergence of the main biologic patterns found in melanocytic proliferations. Our model portrays the extracellular matrix of the dermo-epidermal junction as a two-dimensional manifold and we simulate cellular migration in terms of geometric translations driven by adhesive, repulsive and random forces. Abstracted cellular functions and melanocyte-matrix interactions are modeled as stochastic events. For identification and validation we use visual renderings of simulated cell populations in a horizontal perspective that reproduce growth patterns observed in vivo by sequential dermatoscopy and corresponding vertical views that reproduce the arrangement of melanocytes observed in histopathologic sections. Our results show that a balanced interplay of proliferation and migration produces the typical reticular pattern of nevi, whereas the globular pattern involves additional cellular mechanisms. We further demonstrate that slight variations in the three basic cellular properties proliferation, migration, and adhesion are sufficient to produce a large variety of morphological appearances of nevi. We anticipate our model to be a starting point for the reproduction of more complex scenarios that will help to establish functional connections between abstracted microscopic behavior and macroscopic patterns in all types of melanocytic proliferations including melanoma. © 2021 Schneckenreither et al."

As a rule, rapid change in the working-age population of any territory due to migration processes results in an imbalance in supply and demand on labour markets and a change in the demographic structure of the population. Migration is also to a large extent a reflection of socio-economic processes taking place in the society. Hence, the issues related to the study of migration factors, the direction, intensity and structure of migration flows, and the prediction of their magnitude are becoming topical issues these days. Mathematical tools are often used to analyze, predict migration processes and assess their consequences, allowing for essentially accurate modelling of migration processes for different territories on the basis of the available statistical data. In recent years, quite a number of scientific papers on modelling internal and external migration flows using mathematical methods have appeared both in Russia and in foreign countries in recent years. Consequently, there has been a need to systematize the currently most commonly used methods and tools applied in migration modelling to form a coherent picture of the main trends and research directions in this field. The presented review considers the main approaches to migration modelling and the main components of migration modelling methodology, i. e. stages, methods, models and model classification. Their comparative analysis was also conducted and general recommendations on the choice of mathematical tools for modelling were developed. The review contains two sections: migration modelling methods and migration models. The first section describes the main methods used in the model development process — econometric, cellular automata, system-dynamic, probabilistic, balance, optimization and cluster analysis. Based on the analysis of modern domestic and foreign publications on migration, the most common classes of models — regression, agent-based, simulation, optimization, probabilistic, balance, dynamic and combined — were identified and described.

Empirical data have repeatedly shown the bioregulatory importance of magnesium (Mg) ions in MSC growth and osteogenesis. In this study, we propose an agent-based model to predict the spatiotemporal dynamics of the MSC population and osteogenic differentiation in response to Mg2+ ions. A fuzzy-logic controller was designed to govern the decision-making process of cells by predicting four cellular processes of proliferation, differentiation, migration, and mortality in response to several important bioregulatory factors such as Mg2+ ions, pH, BMP2, and TGF-β1. The model was calibrated using the empirical data obtained from three sets of cell culture experiments. The model successfully reproduced the empirical observations regarding live cell count, viability, DNA content, and the differentiation-related markers of alkaline phosphate (ALP) and osteocalcin (OC). The simulation results, in agreement with the empirical data, showed that Mg2+ ions within 3–6 mM concentration have the highest stimulation effect on cell population growth. The model also correctly reproduced the stimulatory effect of Mg2+ ions on ALP and its inhibitory effect on OC as the early and late differentiation markers, respectively. Besides, the numerical simulation shed light on the innate cellular differences of the cells cultured in different experiments in terms of the proliferative capacity as well as sensitivity to Mg2+ ions. The proposed model can be adopted in the study of the osteogenesis around Mg-based implants where ions released due to degradation interact with local cells and regulate bone regeneration. © 2021 The Authors"

Several animals have the ability to use the inclination or tilt of magnetic field lines as a component of a magnetic compass sense that can be used to maintain migratory headings. In addition, a few animals are able to distinguish among different inclination angles and, in effect, exploit inclination as a surrogate for latitude. Little is known, however, about the role that magnetic inclination plays in guiding long-distance migrations. In this paper, we use an agent-based modelling approach to investigate whether an artificial agent can successfully execute a series of transequatorial migrations by using sequential measurements of magnetic inclination. The agent was tested with multiple navigation strategies in both present-day and reversed magnetic fields. The findings (i) demonstrate that sequential inclination measurements can enable migrations between the northern and southern hemispheres, and (ii) demonstrate that an inclination-based strategy can tolerate a reversed magnetic field, which could be useful in the development of autonomous engineered systems that must be robust to magnetic field changes. The findings also appear to be consistent with the results of some animal navigation experiments, although whether any animal exploits a strategy of using sequential measurements of inclination remains unknown. © 2021 The Author(s)."

A concept demonstrator is developed based on the framework in an attempt to demonstrate the usefulness and practicability of the framework in the context of conflict-induced forced migration in Syria.

A commonly used model for network morphogenesis proposes that sprouts develop through interactions between leader (tip) cells and follower (stalk) cells. In this description, tip cells emerge from existing structures, travel up chemoattractant gradients, and form new networks by guiding the movement of stalk cells. Such dynamics have been mathematically represented by continuum ""snail-trail""models in which the tip cell flux contributes to the stalk cell proliferation rate. Although snail-trail models constitute a classical depiction of leader-follower behavior, their accuracy has yet to be evaluated in a rigorous quantitative setting. Here, we extend the snail-trail modeling framework to two spatial dimensions by introducing a novel multiplicative factor to the stalk cell rate equation, which corrects for neglected network creation in directions other than that of the migrating front. Our derivation of this factor demonstrates that snail-trail models are valid descriptions of cell dynamics when chemotaxis dominates cell movement. We confirm that our snail-trail model accurately predicts the dynamics of tip and stalk cells in an existing agent-based model (ABM) for network formation [Pillay et al., Phys. Rev. E 95, 012410 (2017)10.1103/PhysRevE.95.012410]. We also derive conditions for which it is appropriate to use a reduced, one-dimensional snail-trail model to analyze ABM results.

An underlying assumption of these applications is that tissues grown at the same site share a similar isotopic signal, representative of the location of their origin. However, large variations in tissue isotopic compositions often exist even among conspecific individuals within local populations, which complicates origin and migration inferences. Field-data and correlation analyses have provided hints about the underlying mechanisms of within-site among-individual isotopic variance, but a theory explaining the causes and magnitude of such variance has not been established. Here we develop a mechanistic modeling framework that provides explicit predictions of the magnitude, patterns, and drivers of isotopic variation among individuals living in a common but environmentally heterogeneous habitat. The model toolbox includes isoscape models of environmental isotopic variability, an agent-based model of behavior and movement, and a physiology-biochemistry model of isotopic incorporation into tissues. We compare model predictions against observed variation in hatch-year individuals of the songbird Spotted Towhee (Pipilo maculatus) in Red Butte Canyon, Utah, and evaluate the ability of the model to reproduce this variation under different sets of assumptions. Only models that account for environmental isotopic variability predict a similar magnitude of isotopic variation as observed. Within the modeling framework, behavioral rules and properties govern how animals nesting in different locations acquire resources from different habitats, and birds nesting in or near riparian habitat preferentially access isotopically lighter resources than those associated with the meadow and slope habitats, which results in more negative body water and tissue isotope values. Riparian nesters also have faster body water turnover and acquire more water from drinking (vs. from food), which exerts a secondary influence on their isotope ratios. Thus, the model predicts that local among-individual isotopic variance is linked first to isotopic heterogeneity in the local habitat, and second to how animals sample this habitat during foraging. Model predictions provide insight into the fundamental mechanisms of small-scale isotopic variance and can be used to predict the utility of isotope-based methods for specific groups or environments in ecological and forensic research. © Copyright © 2020 Magozzi, Vander Zanden, Wunder, Trueman, Pinney, Peers, Dennison, Horns, Şekercioğlu and Bowen."

Environmental, interpersonal, and transactional variables such as vegetation and water availability, conflict, ethnic tensions, and private/public land delineation influence the movements of these populations. The challenges of climate change and conflict are widely felt by nomadic pastoralists in Somalia, where resources are scarce, natural disasters are increasingly common, and protracted conflict has plagued communities for decades. Bereft of real-time data, researchers and programmatic personnel often turn to post hoc analysis to understand the interaction between climate, conflict, and migration, and design programs to address the needs of nomadic pastoralists. By designing an Agent-Based Model to simulate the movement of nomadic pastoralists based on typologically-diverse, historical data of environmental, interpersonal, and transactional variables in Somaliland and Puntland between 2008 and 2018, this study explores how pastoralists respond to changing environments. Through subsequent application of spatial analysis such as choropleth maps, kernel density mapping, and standard deviational ellipses, we characterize the resultant pastoralist population distribution in response to these variables. Outcomes demonstrate a large scale spatio-temporal trend of pastoralists migrating to the southeast of the study area with high density areas in the south of Nugaal, the northwest of Sool, and along the Ethiopian border. While minimal inter-seasonal variability is seen, multiple analyses support the consolidation of pastoralists to specifically favorable regions. Exploration of the large-scale population, climate, and conflict trends allows for cogent narratives and associative hypotheses regarding the pastoralist migration during the study period.

Urban management policy must be supported by a comprehensive recognition of bottom-up processes of socio-demographic changes and migration, both throughout the city and in individual districts. Post-war housing estates consistently play a significant role in Polish cities. Maintaining their currently good status, combined with suppression of decline processes, will be one of the biggest challenges of contemporary urban planning and regeneration programmes. The first housing estates are entering a dynamic phase of social and demographic changes that can determine the future development of the city. This article describes the process of collecting and systematizing data on residents and the use of such data to create a virtual model of a large housing estate. The structure of the agent-based model and its modules, using the individuality of the residents and the households in connection with the architectural structure of the housing estate, is presented. In addition, the key information from simulations for the Wrocław Popowice estate were extracted in order to highlight the model's usefulness in providing valuable information about bottom-up processes occurring in the local community. The author advocates using modern simulation methods as a fundamental tool to analyze social processes occurring on large housing estates, in order to support the sustainable development policies of smart cities in Poland. © Peter Lang GmbH Internationaler Verlag der Wissenschaften Berlin 2020.

While the inflammatory response varies in different tissue types, under disease and in response to therapeutic interventions, it has common interactions that occur between immune cells and inflammatory mediators. Understanding these underlying inflammatory mechanisms is key in progressing treatments and therapies for numerous inflammatory conditions. It is now considered that constituent mechanisms of the inflammatory response can be actively manipulated in order to drive resolution of inflammatory damage; particularly, those mechanisms related to the pro-inflammatory role of neutrophils and the anti-inflammatory role of macrophages. In this article, we describe the assembly of a hybrid mathematical model in which the spatial spread of inflammatory mediators is described through partial differential equations, and immune cells (neutrophils and macrophages) are described individually via an agent-based modelling approach. We pay close attention to how immune cells chemotax toward pro-inflammatory mediators, presenting a model for cell chemotaxis that is calibrated against experimentally observed cell trajectories in healthy and COPD-affected scenarios. We illustrate how variations in key model parameters can drive the switch from resolution of inflammation to chronic outcomes, and show that aberrant neutrophil chemotaxis can move an otherwise healthy outcome to one of chronicity. Finally, we reflect on our results in the context of the on-going hunt for new therapeutic interventions. © 2020 Bayani et al.

In this paper, the life cycle and movement of the mauve stinger, Pelagia noctiluca, is simulated from fertilized egg up to the adult stage using an individual-based model (IBM). Our model combines available knowledge on the mauve stinger with inputs of ocean currents and temperature from the CMEMS hydrodynamic model. Horizontal transport is solely governed by ocean currents, but vertical distribution is controlled by diel vertical migration, motility and stage of development. Particle agents are released along the submarine canyons in the Spanish Mediterranean waters during the spring reproduction period, to later disperse and develop through an interplay between physical and biological processes. When compared with a simpler model, that omits behavior and physiology, the biophysical model is able to qualitatively better predict stranding events in the Balearic Sea.

Collective cell motion of eukaryotic cells often includes interactions that result in polar alignment of cell velocities, while bacterial patterns typically show features of apolar velocity alignment. For analysing the population-scale effects of these different alignment mechanisms, various on- and off-lattice agent-based models have been introduced. However, discriminating model-specific artefacts from general features of collective cell motion is challenging. In this work, we focus on equivalence criteria at the population level to compare on- and off-lattice models. In particular, we define prototypic off- and on-lattice models of polar and apolar alignment, and show how to obtain an on-lattice from an off-lattice model of velocity alignment. By characterizing the behaviour and dynamical description of collective migration models at the macroscopic level, we suggest the type of phase transitions and possible patterns in the approximative macroscopic partial differential equation descriptions as informative equivalence criteria between on- and off-lattice models.

This topic is here tackled by a discrete model. Entering in more details, each agent, represented by a material point, is assumed to move following a first-order Newtonian law, which distinguishes speed and orientation. In particular, the latter results from the balance of a given set of behavioural stimuli, each of them defined by a direction and a weight, that quantifies its relative importance. A constraint on the sum of the weights then avoids implausible simultaneous maximization/minimization of all movement traits. Our framework is based on a minimal set of rules and parameters and is able to capture and classify a number of collective group dynamics emerging from different individual preferred behaviour, which possibly includes attractive, repulsive and alignment stimuli. In the case of a system of animals subjected only to the first two behavioural inputs, we also show how analytical arguments allow us to a priori relate the equilibrium interparticle spacing to critical model coefficients. Our approach is then extended to account for the presence of predators with different hunting strategies, which impact on the behaviour of a prey population.

However, high fidelity ABMs, especially those in biomedical applications, usually have a large number of parameters, creating substantial uncertainty and high dimensionality at both local and global levels. Uncertainty analysis (output variance estimation) and sensitivity analysis are essential steps in investigating model robustness. In addition to allocating uncertainty to each parameter, sensitivity analysis can also be used to reduce ABM dimensionality for effective model calibration and optimization.

However, increasing resistance to insecticides threatens to undermine these efforts. Understanding the evolution and propagation of resistance is thus imperative to mitigating loss of intervention effectiveness. Additionally, accelerated research and development of new tools that can be deployed alongside existing vector control strategies is key to eradicating malaria in the near future. Methods such as gene drives that aim to genetically modify large mosquito populations in the wild to either render them refractory to malaria or impair their reproduction may prove invaluable tools. Mathematical models of gene flow in populations, which is the transfer of genetic information from one population to another through migration, can offer invaluable insight into the behavior and potential impact of gene drives as well as the spread of insecticide resistance in the wild. Here, we present the first multi-locus, agent-based model of vector genetics that accounts for mutations and a many-to-many mapping cardinality of genotypes to phenotypes to investigate gene flow, and the propagation of gene drives in Anopheline populations. This model is embedded within a large scale individual-based model of malaria transmission representative of a high burden, high transmission setting characteristic of the Sahel. Results are presented for the selection of insecticide-resistant vectors and the spread of resistance through repeated deployment of insecticide treated nets (ITNs), in addition to scenarios where gene drives act in concert with existing vector control tools such as ITNs. The roles of seasonality, spatial distribution of vector habitat and feed sites, and existing vector control in propagating alleles that confer phenotypic traits via gene drives that result in reduced transmission are explored. The ability to model a spectrum of vector species with different genotypes and phenotypes in the context of malaria transmission allows us to test deployment strategies for existing interventions that reduce the deleterious effects of resistance and allows exploration of the impact of new tools being proposed or developed.

While numerous theories have been forwarded as to why such situations occur, it has remained difficult to empirically test the relative impact of the many interacting processes that produce segmentation in the labor market. In this article, we investigate the processes of ethnic segmentation in low-skilled labor markets, where referral hiring is the norm, with particular reference to the role of ethnically homogeneous social networks and forms of discrimination. We employ an agent-based modeling approach, adapting key elements from Waldinger and Lichter’s widely cited networked explanation of ethnic labor market segmentation. This approach allows us to provide a different lens on theories of ethnic labor market segmentation, investigating the relative impacts of different causal processes that are difficult to investigate in this way using other social science approaches. The overall results from our model indicate that ethnically homogeneous social networks have the effect of increasing the level of ethnic segmentation within a referral-based labor market, but that these networks also help immigrant populations grow and protect them from the negative impacts of employer discrimination. Furthermore, these networks have a greater impact on labor market segmentation than discrimination alone. In conclusion, this sociologically informed agent-based model provides important insights into the manner and extent in which changes in social conditions may affect population-level phenomena. © The Author(s) 2018."

Under favorable environmental conditions flightless juveniles may aggregate into coherent, aligned swarms referred to as hopper bands. These bands are often observed as a propagating wave having a dense front with rapidly decreasing density in the wake. A tantalizing and common observation is that these fronts slow and steepen in the presence of green vegetation. This suggests the collective motion of the band is mediated by resource consumption. Our goal is to model and quantify this effect. We focus on the Australian plague locust, for which excellent field and experimental data is available. Exploiting the alignment of locusts in hopper bands, we concentrate solely on the density variation perpendicular to the front. We develop two models in tandem; an agent-based model that tracks the position of individuals and a partial differential equation model that describes locust density. In both these models, locust are either stationary (and feeding) or moving. Resources decrease with feeding. The rate at which locusts transition between moving and stationary (and vice versa) is enhanced (diminished) by resource abundance. This effect proves essential to the formation, shape, and speed of locust hopper bands in our models. From the biological literature we estimate ranges for the ten input parameters of our models. Sobol sensitivity analysis yields insight into how the band's collective characteristics vary with changes in the input parameters. By examining 4.4 million parameter combinations, we identify biologically consistent parameters that reproduce field observations. We thus demonstrate that resource-dependent behavior can explain the density distribution observed in locust hopper bands. This work suggests that feeding behaviors should be an intrinsic part of future modeling efforts. Copyright © 2020 Bernoff et al."

These new blood vessels allow tumors to continue to grow beyond what the pre-existing vasculature could support. Here, we construct a mathematical model to simulate tumor angiogenesis by considering each endothelial cell as an agent, and allowing the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nutrient fields to impact the dynamics and phenotypic transitions of each tumor and endothelial cell. The phenotypes of the endothelial cells (i.e., tip, stalk, and phalanx cells) are selected by the local VEGF field, and govern the migration and growth of vessel sprouts at the cellular level. Over time, these vessels grow and migrate to the tumor, forming anastomotic loops to supply nutrients, while interacting with the tumor through mechanical forces and the consumption of VEGF. The model is able to capture collapsing and breaking of vessels caused by tumor-endothelial cell interactions. This is accomplished through modeling the physical interaction between the vasculature and the tumor, resulting in vessel occlusion and tumor heterogeneity over time due to the stages of response in angiogenesis. Key parameters are identified through a sensitivity analysis based on the Sobol method, establishing which parameters should be the focus of subsequent experimental efforts. During the avascular phase (i.e., before angiogenesis is triggered), the nutrient consumption rate, followed by the rate of nutrient diffusion, yield the greatest influence on the number and distribution of tumor cells. Similarly, the consumption and diffusion of VEGF yield the greatest influence on the endothelial and tumor cell numbers during angiogenesis. In summary, we present a hybrid mathematical approach that characterizes vascular changes via an agent-based model, while treating nutrient and VEGF changes through a continuum model. The model describes the physical interaction between a tumor and the surrounding blood vessels, explicitly allowing the forces of the growing tumor to influence the nutrient delivery of the vasculature.

Eel passes, narrow sloping channels lined with substrata that enable elvers to ascend, are one way to mitigate against these barriers. Currently, studded eel tiles are a popular substrate. This study is the first to evaluate the flow fields within studded eel tiles and to model the swimming performance of elvers using cellular automata (CA) and individual- (or agent-) based models. Velocities and flow depths predicted by a computational fluid dynamics model of studded eel tiles are first validated against published values for a single installation angle-discharge combination. The validated model is then used to compute three-dimensional flow fields for eel passes at five different installation angles and three inflow discharges. CA and individual-based models are employed to assess upstream passage efficiency for a range of elver sizes. The individual-based model approximates measured passage efficiencies better than the CA model. Passage efficiency is greatest for shallow slopes, low discharges and large elvers. Results are synthesized into an easy-to-understand graphic to help practitioners improve eel pass designs. © 2020 The Authors.

In addition, PES literature is short of ecological metrics that document the consequences of PES other than land use and land cover and its change. Building on detailed survey data from Fanjingshan National Nature Reserve (FNNR), China, we developed and tested an agent-based model to study the complex interactions among human livelihoods (migration and resource extraction in particular), PES, and the Guizhou golden monkey habitat occupancy over 20 years. We then performed simulation-based experiments testing social and ecological impacts of PES payments as well as human population pressures. The results show that with a steady increase in out-migration, the number of land parcels enrolled in one of China’s major PES programs tends to increase, reach a peak, and then slowly decline, showing a convex trend that converges to a stable number of enrolled parcels regardless of payment levels. Simulated monkey occupancy responds to changes in PES payment levels substantially in edge areas of FNNR. Our model is not only useful for FNNR, but also applicable as a platform to study and further understand human and ecological roles of PES in many other complex human-environment systems, shedding light into key elements, interactions, or relationships in the systems that PES researchers and practitioners should bear in mind. Our research contributes to establishing a scientific basis of PES science that incorporates features in complex systems, offering more realistic, spatially and temporally explicit insights related to PES policy or related interventions. © 2020, University of Surrey.

In real ecosystems, the capacity of patch is finite. If a patch is already occupied by the individuals of some species, then the migration into the patch is impossible. For the migration, empty cells are necessary in the destination patch (“nonlinear migration”). In the present article, we deal with two-patch system composed of prey and ambush predator. Preys can migrate between both patches, but predators stay in a single patch. Agent-based model (ABM) is applied in respective patches. Each patch contains a finite number of cells; “capacity” of a patch is defined by the total cell number in the patch. Each cell is either empty or occupied with prey or predator. Reaction-migration equations are presented for non-spatial system of ABM. Both non-spatial and spatial models indicate that the population dynamics are largely affected by the finiteness of respective patches. In particular, we find a self-organized habitat segregation, depending on parameter values. The prey density becomes nearly zero in the predator patch, although many preys live in non-predator patch. Although the migration occurs between both patches, the prey almost disappears in one patch. Such a segregation may be caused by the finite capacity of patches. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."

During embryogenesis, neural crest cells undergo coordinated epithelial to mesenchymal transformations and migrate towards various forming organs. Here we develop a computational model to understand how mutual interactions between migrating neural crest cells (NCs) and the surrounding population of placode cells (PCs) generate coordinated migration. According to experimental findings, we implement a minimal set of hypotheses, based on a coupling between chemotactic movement of NCs in response to a placode-secreted chemoattractant (Sdf1) and repulsion induced from contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL), triggered by heterotypic NC–PC contacts. This basic set of assumptions is able to semi-quantitatively recapitulate experimental observations of the characteristic multispecies phenomenon of “chase-and-run”, where the colony of NCs chases an evasive PC aggregate. The model further reproduces a number of in vitro manipulations, including full or partial disruption of NC chemotactic migration and selected mechanisms coordinating the CIL phenomenon. Finally, we provide various predictions based on altering other key components of the model mechanisms. © 2019, The Author(s)."

As both incidence and survival rates for MI increase, management of post-MI recovery and associated complications are an increasingly important focus. Complexity of the wound healing process and the need for improved therapeutics necessitate a better understanding of the biochemical cues that drive fibrosis. To study the progression of cardiac fibrosis across spatial and temporal scales, we developed a novel hybrid multiscale model that couples a logic-based differential equation (LDE) model of the fibroblast intracellular signaling network with an agent-based model (ABM) of multi-cellular tissue remodeling. The ABM computes information about cytokine and growth factor levels in the environment including TGFβ, TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6, which are passed as inputs to the LDE model. The LDE model then computes the network signaling state of individual cardiac fibroblasts within the ABM. Based on the current network state, fibroblasts make decisions regarding cytokine secretion and deposition and degradation of collagen. Simulated fibroblasts respond dynamically to rapidly changing extracellular environments and contribute to spatial heterogeneity in model predicted fibrosis, which is governed by many parameters including cell density, cell migration speeds, and cytokine levels. Verification tests confirmed that predictions of the coupled model and network model alone were consistent in response to constant cytokine inputs and furthermore, a subset of coupled model predictions were validated with in vitro experiments with human cardiac fibroblasts. This multiscale framework for cardiac fibrosis will allow for systematic screening of the effects of molecular perturbations in fibroblast signaling on tissue-scale extracellular matrix composition and organization. © Copyright © 2019 Rikard, Athey, Nelson, Christiansen, Lee, Holmes, Peirce and Saucerman."

Visualization of urban growth based on the past spatial patterns would help in evolving appropriate policy framework towards the design of sustainable cites for the prudent management of natural resources.

Comparative assessment of the model performance through accuracy assessment and Kappa (relatively significant at p < 0.05) indicates the superior performance of the agent-based model approaches due to its interaction with factors and constraints that allow urban growth in the region.

To reduce the risk to biodiversity, there is a need for connected, interjurisdictional landscape management plans at regional levels. It is a key to identify how decision-makers collaborate and share knowledge, learn, and ultimately make decisions affecting species coexistence. Here, we present a model that mimics multiple political jurisdictions making decisions affecting species migration across a landscape. This management and species movement can be between nations, between public and private landowners, or any other scale of interjurisdictional management in between. The model we present here has direct application to the decisions that managers make regularly and draws upon anecdotal evidence from real-world case studies such as the removal of fences in the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park in southern Africa, and cooperation to solve regional environmental dilemmas in Arizona between neighbors. Our results highlight the importance of social learning and networks and matching the scale of sociopolitical and ecological processes in order to reduce biodiversity loss. Further, we find that close-knit decision-makers, especially when learning/imitating management strategies the same way, are detrimental to countering biodiversity loss.

Although cyber-physical production systems (CPPS) provide the means to cope with complexity and flexibility, the migration with existing control systems is still a challenge. The term CPPS denotes a mechatronic system (physical world) coupled with software entities and digital information (cyber part), both enabling the smart factory concept for the Industry 4.0 (I4.0) paradigm. In this regard, design patterns could help developers to build their software with common solutions for manufacturing control derived from experiences. We provide a description and comparison of the already existing multi-agent systems (MAS) design patterns, which were collected and classified by introducing two classification criteria to support MAS developers. The applicability of these criteria is shown in the case of specific example architectures from the lower and higher control levels. The authors, together with experts from the German Agent Systems committee FA 5.15, gathered more than twenty MAS patterns, evaluated, and compared four selected patterns with the presented criteria and terminology. The main contribution is a CPPS architecture that fulfills requirements related to the era of smart factories, as well as the Reference Architectural Model I4.0 (RAMI 4.0).

The coordination between leader cell and follower cell affects the rate of collective cell migration. However, there are still very few papers on the impacts of the stimulus signal released by the leader on the follower. Tracking cell movement using 3D time-lapse microscopy images provides an unprecedented opportunity to systematically study and analyze collective cell migration. Results: Recently, deep reinforcement learning algorithms have become very popular. In our paper, we also use this method to train the number of cells and control signals. By experimenting with single-follower cell and multi-follower cells, it is concluded that the number of stimulation signals is proportional to the rate of collective movement of the cells. Such research provides a more diverse approach and approach to studying biological problems. Conclusion: Traditional research methods are always based on real-life scenarios, but as the number of cells grows exponentially, the research process is too time consuming. Agent-based modeling is a robust framework that approximates cells to isotropic, elastic, and sticky objects. In this paper, an agent-based modeling framework is used to establish a simulation platform for simulating collective cell migration. The goal of the platform is to build a biomimetic environment to demonstrate the importance of stimuli between the leading and following cells. © 2019 The Author(s)."

Experimental observations, however, show that this assumption is often far from the real cell cycle time distribution (CCTD). Recent studies have suggested an alternative approach to modelling cell proliferation based on a multi-stage representation of the CCTD. In this paper we investigate the connection between the CCTD and the speed of the collective invasion. We first state a result for a general CCTD, which allows the computation of the invasion speed using the Laplace transform of the CCTD. We use this to deduce the range of speeds for the general case. We then focus on the more realistic case of multi-stage models, using both a stochastic agent-based model and a set of reaction-diffusion equations for the cells’ average density. By studying the corresponding travelling wave solutions, we obtain an analytical expression for the speed of invasion for a general N-stage model with identical transition rates, in which case the resulting cell cycle times are Erlang distributed. We show that, for a general N-stage model, the Erlang distribution and the exponential distribution lead to the minimum and maximum invasion speed, respectively. This result allows us to determine the range of possible invasion speeds in terms of the average proliferation time for any multi-stage model. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

The reproduction of fish producing semi-buoyant eggs requires a specific hydrodynamic condition. To predict the influence of cascade hydropower development on the reproductive process of fish with semi-buoyant eggs, a MIKE 21 Flow Model was applied. Lagrangian particle tracking was used to simulate the movement of semi-buoyant eggs and larvae using the Agent-based Modeling (ABM) lab module. The calibrated model showed good agreement between the simulated and observed data for the hydrodynamic process in the reservoir. Twelve scenarios were defined to fully understand whether fish with semi-buoyant eggs can reproduce naturally. The results showed the following: (1) It is difficult to form a fish migration passage in the reservoir in all potential scenarios. (2) Semi-buoyant eggs and larvae sank to the bottom and perished before they hatched and were old enough to survive, since the hydrodynamic conditions could not meet the minimum flow velocity required to keep them in the drift. (3) Even if the hydrodynamic conditions can keep them in the drift in impossible high-discharge conditions, there was not enough drifting time and distance in the reservoir. The results implied that fishes with semi-buoyant eggs cannot reproduce naturally in the main stream, but it is possible that they can reproduce successfully after the protection of the tributary. The method is transferrable to other locations via establishment of models with relevant data to a particular area. © 2019"

One of the challenges in coupling ABM to FEM is that these two domains typically employ grid or element sizes that differ by several orders of magnitude. Here, we develop and demonstrate an interpolation-based method for mapping between ABM and FEM domains of different resolutions that is suitable for linear and nonlinear FEM meshes and balances accuracy with computational demands. We then explore the effects of refining the FEM mesh and the ABM grid in the setting of a fully coupled model. ABM grid refinement studies showed unexpected effects of grid size whenever cells were present at a high enough density for crowding to affect proliferation and migration. In contrast to an FE-only model, refining the FE mesh in the coupled model increased strain differences between adjacent finite elements. Allowing strain-dependent feedback on collagen turnover magnified the effects of regional heterogeneity, producing highly nonlinear spatial and temporal responses.

Several studies suggest that malaria persistence in the area can be connected with a high prevalence of asymptomatic infections, which were subsequently shown to be connected with work-related exposure in areas of hyperendemic transmission. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the infection reservoir represented by asymptomatic carriers in the northern Peruvian Amazon, combined with circular human movement to and from hyperendemic working areas, can capture the observed hypoendemic malaria transmission. Methods: We designed a set of agent-based models that represent local-scale malaria transmission in a typical riverine community in the northern Peruvian Amazon. The models include asymptomatic individuals as well as a full representation of human movements within the community and between the community and external hyperendemic working places. Several theoretical scenarios are explored to verify if and how malaria clinical immunity prevalence and human work-related movements influence the malaria morbidity registered in the community. Results: Agent-based simulations suggest that malaria incidence observed through passive case detection can be reproduced as exclusively generated by the asymptomatic infection reservoir. Scenarios analysis also show that, even if asymptomatic infections are completely eliminated, human movements to and from hyperendemic working areas generate a flow of imported cases that is enough to permit the persistence of transmission in the community. Simulation results were verified over a wide range of clinical immunity prevalence values and over a wide range of percentages of people working in remote hyperendemic areas. This context of unstable malaria transmission is observed to be vulnerable to severe outbreaks. Conclusions: Asymptomatic malaria infection and occupational circular human movement to hyperendemic transmission areas are designated by agent-based models as possible exclusive causes of residual hypoendemic malaria transmission observed in the Peruvian Amazon. Control strategies are proposed to decrease asymptomatic infection prevalence and to block transmission from asymptomatic individuals to the malaria susceptible population. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."

The authors pay attention to specific problems of migration in the Arctic regions of Eurasia. It is proposed to use a combination of analytical and simulation modeling to enhance the quality of prognoses for migration flows. Two parts of the ongoing research are described: technology of entropy-robust identification of the parameters of simulation models and a set of simulation models. The technology of entropy-robust assessment is based on the idea of re-use of formalized knowledge in the analysis of statistical characteristics of the parameters of simulation models. The technology allows to shorten the time and reduce the complexity of development of appropriate simulation models of migration. The complex of simulation models is developed on the basis of a combination of system dynamics, discrete-event and agent-based modeling. The integration of agent-based and analytical modeling to create simulation models of migration processes allows, on the one hand, to ensure the accuracy of the simulation according to the quality of the source data, and on the other, to analyze socioeconomic systems at the required level of abstraction.

Songbirds have previously been described as agents of tick dispersal, and a combination of empirical data and modeling efforts have implicated songbirds in the range expansion of I. scapularis northward into Canada during spring bird migration. The role of fall bird migration has received comparatively less attention, particularly at a continental scale. The aim of the current research was to use a novel individual-based modeling approach (IBM) to investigate the role of southward migrating songbirds in the dispersal of I. scapularis within the continental United States. The IBM used in this research explicitly models dispersal by two extensively studied migrating songbird species, wood thrush Hylocichla mustelina and ovenbird Seiurus aurocapillus. Our IBM predicts the annual dispersal of more than four million ticks by H. mustelina and S. aurocapillus, notably into areas as far west as the Dakotas, and as far south as Central Alabama. Predicted dispersal locations include areas where the southern phenotype of I. scapularis dominates, suggestive of a possible mechanism for previously described unidirectional gene flow from north to south. In addition, the model demonstrates that three species-specific songbird traits – breeding range, migration timing, and propensity for tick attachment – each play a major role in the relative magnitude of tick dispersal by different songbird species. The pattern of I. scapularis dispersal predicted by this model suggests that migrating songbirds may have contributed to the range expansion of the tick historically, and may continue to do so presently and into the future, particularly as climate changes the geographic areas that are suitable for I. scapularis. Ultimately, widespread tick dispersal by migrating songbirds likely increases the human risk of Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases in the United States. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH"

This intrinsically leads to complex stochastic behavior, particularly when several cells are integrated with one microscale object. In this work, we describe the stochastic dynamics of a distributed network of BacteriaBots, microparticles decorated with engineered E. coli bacteria with the capacity for directed migration (chemotaxis) and chemical cell-cell communication (quorum sensing, QS). We developed a statistical model of BacteriaBot motility and chemotaxis which was integrated with an agent-based computational platform to accurately capture their spatiotemporal migration and QS functionality.

Over the past century, numerous processes have been identified as critically contributing to morphogenetic events, but the interplay between the various components and aspects of pattern formation have been much harder to grasp. The combination of traditional biology with mathematical and computational methods has had a profound effect on our current understanding of morphogenesis and led to significant insights and advancements in the field. In particular, the theoretical concepts of reaction-diffusion systems and positional information, proposed by Alan Turing and Lewis Wolpert, respectively, dramatically influenced our general view of morphogenesis, although typically in isolation from one another. In recent years, agent-based modeling has been emerging as a consolidation and implementation of the two theories within a single framework. Agent-based models (ABMs) are unique in their ability to integrate combinations of heterogeneous processes and investigate their respective dynamics, especially in the context of spatial phenomena. In this review, we highlight the benefits and technical challenges associated with ABMs as tools for examining morphogenetic events.

A special focus is given to rural areas, and the possible effects of different climate change scenarios on internal migration patterns. To achieve this, I prepared an agent-based modelling tool, which implements four different migration types with distinct flows and characteristic participant groups (student migration, labour migration, suburbanisation, amenity migration). In overall, 33 scenarios were elaborated, which may differ from each other in their fertility and mortality assumptions, their climatic predictions, and their anticipated socioeconomic paradigm. According to the low natural movement scenarios, the Hungarian population may shrink to 8,342 thousand inhabitants by 2051, while the high natural movement scenarios anticipate 9,138 thousand inhabitants. A drastic shift in the age structure can also be expected: the old-age-dependency ratio will increase from 25% (2011) to 61-65%. The territorial differences in ageing will also deepen, which will pose serious social sustainability challenges. From the three delimited spatial categories (urban areas, commutable rural areas, remote rural areas), the forecasts show the greatest variance in case of the remote rural areas. This is caused by the considerable shift in the migration patterns between the Business as usual and Paradigm shift socioeconomic scenarios. In contrast to this, the implementation of the different climatic scenarios did not bring significant changes. It is important to note, however, that switching to Paradigm shift scenarios from the Business as usual ones did strengthen the effect of the climatic scenarios. This indicates that the upcoming effects of climate change will not only depend on the alterations in the climatic components, but also on the socioeconomic conditions. © 2020 authors."

The first post-war housing estates are inevitably approaching the end of their intended life span and, unfortunately, thus far a method to extensively test and monitor these housing estates has not yet been established. Currently, attention is focused purely on analysing the technical condition of the buildings, while the most important issue, that is, their present and future residents, is ignored. Collecting the necessary data on large residential estates is the first, extremely important step towards understanding the processes taking place in European cities. Thanks to agent-based modelling, which utilises both the decision-making and the uniqueness of individuals and households, a detailed analysis of bottom-up processes that occur naturally in the local community is possible. Using one of the Polish housing estates, Popowice in Wrocław, as an example, available statistical data was systematised and simulations were carried out to predict the natural, spontaneous development of the estate. The simulations reflect the dynamics of the bottom-up processes within the local population that have a direct impact on the scale of migration, as well as the socio-demographic polarization of the local community. Intentionally, the top-down approach has not been implemented in order to allow identification and analysis of self-modifying changes. In this simulation, trends are sought only based on the autonomy of individual people. The need to make a precise diagnosis and establish guidelines for revitalization plays a key role in the management of urban space.

In this review, we highlight scenarios in cell migration where mathematical modelling can be applied and discuss what types of modelling are most suited. Almost any aspect of cell migration is amenable to mathematical modelling from the modelling of intracellular processes such as chemokine receptor signalling and actin filament branching to larger scale processes such as the movement of individual cells or populations of cells through their environment. Two common ways of approaching this modelling are the use of models based on differential equations or agent-based modelling.

From the software productivity viewpoint, model designers would prefer general ABM frameworks for GPU parallelization. However, having transited from single-node or cluster-computing platforms to GPUs, most general ABM frameworks maintain their APIs at the script level, delegate only a limited number of agent functions to GPUs, and copy agent data between host and device memory for each function call, which cannot ease agent description nor maximize GPU parallelism. To respond to these problems, we have developed the MASS (Multi-Agent Spatial Simulation) CUDA library that allows users to describe all simulation models in CUDA C++, to automate entire model parallelization at GPU, and to minimize host-to-device memory transfer. However, our straightforward implementation did not improve the parallel performance. Focusing on the data-parallel computation with GPU, we examined MASS overheads in GPU memory usage and developed optimization techniques that reduce kernel context switches, optimize kernel configuration, use constant memory, and reduce overheads incurred by agent population, migration, and termination. These techniques improved Heat2D and SugarScape’s execution performance, respectively 3.9 times and 5.8 times faster than the corresponding C++ sequential programs.

Models of appropriate complexity facilitate comprehension and improve understanding of the variables driving system processes. In the context of conservation planning decision-making or research efforts, a useful model can aid interpretation and avoid overfitting by including only essential elements. Models can serve two related, but different purposes: understanding and prediction of future system behavior. Predictive models can require several iterations of refinement and empirical data gathering to be useful for conservation planning. Models with less predictive ability can be used to enhance understanding of system function and generate hypotheses for empirical evaluation. Modeling monarch butterfly systems, whether it be landscape-scale movement in breeding habitats, migratory behavior, or population dynamics at monthly or yearly timeframes, is challenging because the systems encompass complex spatial and temporal interactions across nested scales that are difficult, if not impossible, to empirically observe or comprehend without simplification. We review mathematical, statistical, and simulation models that have provided insights into monarch butterfly systems. Mathematical models have provided understanding of underlying processes that may be driving monarch systems. Statistical models have provided understanding of patterns in empirical data, which may represent underlying mechanisms. Simulations models have provided understanding of mechanisms driving systems and provide the potential to link mechanisms with data to build more predictive models. As an example, recently published agent-based models of non-migratory eastern North American monarch butterfly movement and egg-laying may provide the means to explore how different spatial patterns of habitat, habitat quality, and the interaction of stressors can influence future adult recruitment. The migratory process, however, has not been addressed with agent-based modeling. Using western monarch migration as an example, we describe how modeling could be used to provide insights into migratory dynamics. Future integration of migratory models with non-migratory and population dynamics models may provide better understanding and ultimately prediction of monarch butterfly movement and population dynamics at a continental scale. © 2019 Grant and Bradbury."

VEGF-A is the main pro-angiogenic chemoattractant and it can bind to the decoy receptor VEGFR1 or to VEGFR2 to induce sprouting. Active sprout cells express Dll4, which binds to Notch1 on neighboring cells, in turn inhibiting VEGFR2 expression. It is known that the balance between VEGFR2 and VEGFR1 determines tip selection and network architecture, however the quantitative interrelationship of the receptors and their interrelated balances, also with relation to Dll4-Notch1 signaling, remains yet largely unknown. Here, we present an agent-based computer model of sprouting angiogenesis, integrating VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 in a detailed model of cellular signaling. Our model reproduces experimental data on VEGFR1 knockout. We show that soluble VEGFR1 improves the efficiency of angiogenesis by directing sprouts away from existing cells over a wide range of parameters. Our analysis unravels the relevance of the stability of the active notch intracellular domain as a dominating hub in this regulatory network. Our analysis quantitatively dissects the regulatory interactions in sprouting angiogenesis. Because we use a detailed model of intracellular signaling, the results of our analysis are directly linked to biological entities.

Much of it will have to migrate towards the poles at a rate far beyond normal speeds. In this context, the concept of assisted migration has been proposed to facilitate the migration of trees. Yet current practices of assisted migration focus on “where tree species should be in the future” and thus have many uncertainties. We suggest that more attention should be paid on the flow of forest migration. Therefore, this study develops a three-step methodology for mapping the flow of forest migration under climate change. Since the migration of trees depends on the activities of their seed dispersal agents, the accessibility of landscapes for dispersal agents is mainly considered in this study. The developed method combines a least-cost path model, a graph-based approach, and a circuit theory-based model. The least-cost path model is applied to map the movement of dispersal agents, based on which graph-based indices are used to evaluate the accessibility of landscapes for dispersal agents, which in turn is used as the basis for circuit theory-based modelling to map the flow of forest migration. The proposed method is demonstrated by a case study in the Greater Manchester area, UK. The resulting maps identify areas with high probability of climate-driven migration of trees. © 2019 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal)."

In the last decade, a number of centralized control strategies based on native biological mechanisms have been demonstrated; however, decentralized cooperative control of a swarm of bio-hybrid microrobots has rarely been explored. In this work, we use our previously developed agent-based computational model to explore the utility of integrating synthetic biology with bio-hybrid microrobotics with the goal of developing strategies for robust decentralized control of bio-hybrid microrobotic systems. To this end, our Nanoscale Bacteria-Enabled Autonomous Delivery System (NanoBEADS), wherein each agent is comprised of an Escherichia coli bacterium conjugated with an ensemble of nanoparticles, was used as a model system. We imparted bacteria with engineered biological circuits to facilitate agent-agent communication and enable predictable and robust cooperative control of a network of NanoBEADS agents. We developed a hybrid control strategy wherein a centralized chemotaxis-based control scheme is used to direct migration, and a decentralized quorum sensing (QS)-based control scheme enables the agents to independently coordinate a cooperative behavior (fluorescent protein expression). We then computationally analyzed the role of bacterial subsystem properties and spatiotemporal changes in population organization in the emergent behavior (i.e., the activation time of the QS response) of the NanoBEADS. We show that the spatial changes in NanoBEADS agents’ distribution, in response to the centralized control input, and the mass transport boundary conditions are critical factors in determining the dynamics as well as the sensitivity and robustness of the QS response. We analyze the stark differences in feasible QS parameter domains under dissimilar chemoattractant gradients and show that the flow boundary conditions may greatly influence system function. Altogether, we show that a bacteria-based bio-hybrid system must be designed with careful consideration of growth rate, chemotaxis properties, QS properties, and the environment initial and boundary conditions in the context of its target application.

Mouse fibroblasts lacking functional Arp2/3 complex have the characteristic smooth, veil-like lamellipodial leading edge of wild-type cells replaced by a massive, bifurcating filopodia-like protrusions (FLPs) with fractal geometry. The nanometer-scale actin-network organization of these FLPs can be linked to the fractal geometry of the cell boundary by a self-organized criticality through the bifurcation behavior of cross-linked actin bundles. Despite the pivotal role of the Arp2/3 complex in cell migration, the cells lacking functional Arp2/3 complex migrate at rates similar to wild-type cells. However, these cells display defects in the persistence of a directional movement. We suggest that Arp2/3 complex suppresses the formation of FLPs by locally fine-tuning actin networks and favoring dendritic geometry over bifurcating bundles, giving cells a distinct evolutionary edge by providing the means for a directed movement. © 2018, International Union for Pure and Applied Biophysics (IUPAB) and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

In the State of Kuwait, there is a unique set of push and pull factors: government subsidised housing for citizens, the existence of a single urban area, and the initiation of a new and ambitious master plan for the construction of 12 new cities, which are expected to attract not only locals, but also international residents and businesses. On top of these factors, there is an unusual demographic situation, as non-citizens outnumber Kuwaiti citizens by a factor of 2.3, with these groups having widely different preferences in terms of housing. Currently, there is no plan to take these resident groups’ opinions into consideration for the new cities project. Besides, the current study simulates the impacts of the involvement of residents in urban planning. Samples from resident groups (citizens and non-citizens) participated in targeted surveys and useful answers were extracted in relation to the migration likelihood, push and pull factors that May affect their decisions, spatial preferences for new cities and their opinions on segregation by nationality. Specifically, the survey results showed significant interest of residents in moving to the new cities. For citizens, the most important factors in deciding whether to move or not were proximity to their close family and housing availability, while for non-citizens the most important factor was the creation of new employment opportunities. Both survey groups agreed that existing city property prices are too high and make the prospect of moving to a new city more attractive. The responses were transferred in an Agent Based Model, and the simulations showed certain differences to the official projections for 2050 without the public responses, in regards to the geographical distribution of the most desirable suburbs. Furthermore, the simulations showed that in the new cities, nationality segregation levels are expected to drop by at Least 15% compared to the 2015 levels.

The first-order emergence, also referred to as swarm intelligence, is well studied, while higher order levels of emergent behaviour have not received much attention yet. Second-order emergent behaviour arises from the interactions of individuals, which are themselves the result of first-order emergent behaviour. Dictyostelium discoideum provides a compelling case for studying both first- and second-order emergence. Individual cells move around on their own when there is plenty of food. When food is scarce, cells self-aggregate towards a leading center cell (first-order emergent behaviour) to build a super-organism, similar to a slug. The slug displays properties that none of the cells has on its own (e.g. sensitivity to light and heat). It moves as a whole (second-order emergent behaviour) looking for a suitable place to transform into a fruiting body (also known as sporocarp), where later the cells resume their individual behaviour. This paper focuses specifically on the aggregation and migration phases of Dictyostelium discoideum. We present two agent-based models, implemented in Matlab for first order and Python for second order. They display a series of emergent properties, among others homogeneous aggregation territories size (first order) and merging of slugs or new property as sensitivity to light (second order). Future works involve implementing and experimenting both first- and second-order emergence in swarm robotics, and identification of design patterns for engineering higher order emergent behaviour in artificial systems. © 2018, ISAROB."

Models are particularly useful when dealing with complex dynamic systems (as pelagic ecosystems) where data are limited and if various ‘what if’ scenarios should be tested. The aim of this study was to produce and implement an integrated modelling approach, linking high resolution hydrodynamic models (HDM) of the marine environment with correlative species distribution models (SDM) and agent-based models (ABM), for describing the spatio-temporal distribution and movements of Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) in the Norwegian Sea. The SDM was fitted with scientific mackerel trawl data as response variables (collected in July and August 2006–2014) and temperature (from the HDM), water depth and time period as predictors of spatial distributions. The SDM was able to produce dynamic predictions of a similar order of magnitude as observed catch per unit effort (CPUE) as well as realistic large-scale distribution patterns, when tested on independent data (not included in the modelling). The ABM was calibrated, with normalized SDM predictions (habitat suitability as a proxy for food availability) and hydrodynamics as input and simulated on a single year (2013) for the period May–October, when the migratory mackerel is present in the study area. A pattern-oriented modelling (POM) approach was used to verify if the model reproduced multiple observed real-world patterns. The ABM produced similar patterns as observed regarding migration timing, growth and large scale geographic distribution. Fine scaled information on mackerel movement and behaviour is limited, which is also reflected in the results. More data and knowledge are therefore required to improve the patterns emerging from fine scaled processes. The potential of the model for assessing an impact of a single seismic survey (mimicking a real survey) was finally evaluated. The exercise allowed estimating the number of affected fish (within 50 km from the sound source) and potential changes in local migrations, with the specific assumed minimum sound pressure thresholds (resulting in a fleeing reaction by the mackerel) set to 165 dB re 1 μPa. The model framework was shown to be useful by allowing simulations of impact scenarios in a realistic and dynamic environment. The model can be further updated when data on fine scale movements of mackerel and most importantly when improved data on response behaviour to impacts of sound become available. © 2018 Elsevier B.V."

Four search algorithms were applied (random search, mutation hill climber, genetic algorithm and simulated annealing) to find the range of parameters that lead to fast emigration of the colony.

The model employed only individual-level rules but accurately emulated group-level properties observed in empirical studies. Simulations suggest that in this system i) both social and private information are necessary for effective decision making, ii) decision making was effective even with very low numbers of ‘discriminating’ individuals, iii) individual acceptance thresholds were more influential than quorum thresholds in tuning decisions to emphasise speed or accuracy, and iv) acceptance thresholds could also help tune decisions to suit environmental complexity.

T cell activation occurs when dendritic cells, which have already interacted with the pathogen, scan a T cell that is cognate for (responsive to) the pathogen. This often occurs inside lymph nodes. The time it takes for this scanning event to occur, indeed the probability that it will occur at all, depends on many factors, including the rate that T cells and dendritic cells enter and leave the lymph node as well as the geometry of the lymph node and of course other cellular and molecular parameters. In this paper, we develop a hybrid stochastic-deterministic mathematical model at the tissue scale of the lymph node and simulate dendritic cells and cognate T cells to investigate the most important physiological factors leading to a successful and timely immune response after a vaccination. We use an agent-based model to describe the small population of cognate naive T cells and a partial differential equation description for the concentration of mature dendritic cells. We estimate the model parameters based on the known literature and measurements previously taken in our lab. We perform a parameter sensitivity analysis to quantify the sensitivity of the model results to the parameters. The results show that increasing T cell inflow through high endothelial venules, restricting cellular egress via the efferent lymph and increasing the total dendritic cell count by improving vaccinations are the among the most important physiological factors leading to an improved immune response. We also find that increasing the physical size of lymph nodes improves the overall likelihood that an immune response will take place but has a fairly weak effect on the response rate. The nature of dendritic cell trafficking through the LN (either passive or active transport) seems to have little effect on the overall immune response except if a change in overall egress time is observed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

Besides forming a geographical barrier, mountains have a profound impact on the resulting wind flow. We use a novel framework of mathematical models to investigate the influences of wind and topography on nocturnal passerine bird behaviour, and to assess the energy costs for different flight strategies for crossing the Jura Mountains. The mathematical models include three biological models of bird behaviour: i) wind drift compensation; ii) adaptation of flight height for favourable winds; and, iii) avoidance of obstacles (cross over and/or circumvention of an obstacle following a minimum energy expenditure strategy), which are assessed separately and in combination. Further, we use a mesoscale weather model for high-resolution predictions of the wind fields. We simulate the broad front nocturnal passerine migration for autumn nights with peak migration intensities. The bird densities retrieved from a weather radar are used as the initial intensities and to specify the vertical distributions of the simulated birds. It is shown that migration over complex terrain represents the most expensive flight option in terms of energy expenditure, and wind is seen to be the main factor that influences the energy expenditure in the bird's preferred flight direction. Further, the combined effects of wind and orography lead to a high concentration of migratory birds within the favourable wind conditions of the Swiss lowlands and north of the Jura Mountains. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

Previous efforts have demonstrated that agent-based, multi-scale modeling systems can integrate physical and biological rules and provide new avenues to study developmental systems. However, the application of these systems to model cell movement is still challenging and requires a comprehensive understanding of regulatory networks at the right scales. Recent developments in deep learning and reinforcement learning provide an unprecedented opportunity to explore cell movement using 3D time-lapse microscopy images. Results: We present a deep reinforcement learning approach within an agent-based modeling system to characterize cell movement in the embryonic development of C.elegans. Our modeling system captures the complexity of cell movement patterns in the embryo and overcomes the local optimization problem encountered by traditional rule-based, agent-based modeling that uses greedy algorithms. We tested our model with two real developmental processes: the anterior movement of the Cpaaa cell via intercalation and the rearrangement of the superficial left-right asymmetry. In the first case, the model results suggested that Cpaaa’s intercalation is an active directional cell movement caused by the continuous effects from a longer distance (farther than the length of two adjacent cells), as opposed to a passive movement caused by neighbor cell movements. In the second case, a leader-follower mechanism well explained the collective cell movement pattern in the asymmetry rearrangement. These results showed that our approach to introduce deep reinforcement learning into agent-based modeling can test regulatory mechanisms by exploring cell migration paths in a reverse engineering perspective.

This expectation is difficult to test empirically for three reasons. First, unauthorized migration is clandestine and often unobservable. Second, interpersonal ties between migrants and would-be migrants form a self-perpetuating system, which adapts in ways that are difficult to observe or predict. Third, empirical evaluations of immigration policy are vulnerable to endogeneity and other issues of causal inference. In this paper, we pair tailor-made empirical designs with an agent-based computational model (ABM) to capture the dynamics of a migration system that often elude empirical analysis, while grounding agent rules and characteristics with primary data collected in Jamaica, an origin country. We find that some government-imposed restrictions on migrants can deter total migration, but others are ineffective. Relative to a system of free movement, the minimal eligibility conditions required to classify migrants into visa categories alone make migration inaccessible for many. Restrictive policies imposed on student and high-skilled visa categories have little added effect because eligible individuals are likely able to migrate through alternative legal categories. Meanwhile, restrictions on family-based visas result in significant reductions in total migration. However, they also produce the largest reorientation toward unauthorized channels—an unintended consequence that even the highest rates of apprehension do not effectively. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

In fact, the mechanical behavior of each domain is affected by the presence of cells from the discrete model. Moreover, we solve this mechanical problem using the finite element method (FEM). The forces generated by cells are projected to the FE mesh, that is created dynamically during the simulation from the discrete cell representation. After the FE resolution, we use the mesh displacements to determine the new cell positions in the agent-based model. Finally, to demonstrate the potential of this approach to model epithelial tissue mechanics, we simulate two well-studied cases of collective cell migration: durotaxis and gap closure.

Still, in such areas, where traditional data-driven, statistical approaches prevail, the hypothesis-driven design of agent-based models leads to questioning the validity of these models. Consequently, suitable means to increase the confidence into models and simulation results are required. To that end, explicit, replicable simulation experiments play a central role in model design and validation. However, the analysis of more complex models implies executing various experiments, each of which combines various methods. To streamline these experimentation processes a flexible computational simulation environment is necessary. With a new binding between SESSL – an internal domain-specific language for simulation experiments – and ML3 – a simulator for linked lives designed specifically for agent-based demographic models – we cater for these objectives and provide a powerful simulation tool. The proposed approach can serve as a foundation for current efforts of employing advanced and statistical model analysis of agent-based demographic models, as part of a wider process of iterative model building.

Agent-based models (ABMs) are valuable tools to study these linkages because they can represent individual migration decisions of human actors. Indeed, there is an increasing, yet small, number of ABMs that consider the natural environment in rural migration processes. Therefore, we reviewed 15 ABMs of environment-migration linkages in rural contexts to synthesize the current state of the art. The reviewed ABMs are mostly applied in tropical contexts, serve a wide range of purposes, and cover diverse scales and types of environmental factors, migration processes, and social-ecological feedbacks. We identified potential for future model development with respect to the (1) complexity of environmental influence factors, (2) representation of relevant migration flows, and (3) type of social-ecological couplings. We found that existing models tend to not include fully integrated feedbacks and provide recommendations for the further development of ABMs to contribute to an understanding of the environment-migration-nexus in the future. © 2018 by the author(s)."

It proposes that service delivery network design would benefit from complex adaptive systems (CAS) modeling approaches to recreate organizational phenomena driven by the interaction of the organization with its operating environment. This approach, paired with experimental design methods can serve as a virtual laboratory. We take the case of social service delivery (SSD) organizations that are structured as nonprofit organizations providing humanitarian assistance and relief services. These organizations often serve different geographical regions, thus, racial composition, migration patterns, and wealth of the populations served are factors that vary between locations. SSDs operate through service nodes (i.e., field offices, chapters, branches) in a network configuration. Therefore, the managerial decision of where to locate the field offices is an important one. An agent-based model to recreate agents’ interactions as proxies of those exchanges occurring in real SSD settings is used. A series of validation experiments instill confidence that our model can be used as a virtual research laboratory. This paper contributes to the field of organizational design by testing a model able to recreate different policies that combined with different operating conditions impact the network over time and space. In addition, it provides experimental insights on what type of network configuration might provide a higher number of services delivered over time across the service network. The results can inform those defining the service system architecture looking to achieve SSD's goals considering the demographics of the markets served. © 2018"

The iTLE assumes that individuals and households are the agents, and parcels are the objects. It is conceptualized following the life-course perspectives and theories to address the evolution of multi-domain decision interactions over the life-course of the agents. Residential location is simulated as a two-stage process of residential mobility, and location choice. Life-stage simulation includes aging, death, birth, out-migration, in-migration, and household formation. The iTLE is implemented at a yearly time-step from 2006 to 2021 for Halifax, Canada. A 100% synthetic population is generated for the base year 2006, which shows a SRMSE value of 0.37 and APE measures of less than 5% for 89% of the DAs. The simulation results are validated with the 2011 Census information. The validation results suggest that the iTLE generates reasonably satisfactory population estimates. For example, around 52% of the DAs show an APE value of less than 30%, and 37% of the DAs show a difference in the number of households of less than ±50. The predicted results regarding the spatio-temporal evolution of Halifax suggests an increase of around 14% population in 2021 compared to 2007. Younger population residing closer to the CBD are predicted to be more frequent movers than older population residing farther away from the CBD. Higher proportions of the households are predicted in the locations within 25 km from the CBD over the years. Proportion of households in these high density neighborhoods are predicted to increase from 68% in 2007 to 71% in 2021. In 2021, a higher density of single person households are predicted in the urban core. Density is predicted to be more variable and skewed towards suburban neighborhoods as household composition changes through marriage and child birth. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

An appealing characteristic of aeroecology is that we can observe both these aggregate behaviors of large groups (using tools such as radar and observational networks) as well as the behavior of individual animals (by employing animal tracking technology). Traditional population modeling efforts focus on equations that mimic natural populations in terms of overall population size and/or mean population parameters, often discounting mechanisms operating on the individual level that give rise to overall population dynamics. Concurrent advancements in computing capacity and animal tracking methodologies provide us with the opportunity to examine how the actions of individuals scale up to give rise to population-level phenomena in the aerosphere. More specifically, we can now model populations as a collection of individuals that behave independently, and we can validate the inferences from these agent-based models by tracking actual animals over the course of their annual cycle. In this chapter, we provide an example of how an agent-based model can be used to predict migration behavior across a species range based on a small set of actual migration tracks.

Properly selecting and applying such metrics requires substantial background in mathematics and understanding the relevant management arena. To address this multidimensional challenge, we demonstrate and compare three measurements of habitat quality: graph-, occupancy-, and demographic-based metrics. Each metric provides insights into system dynamics, at the expense of increasing amounts and complexity of data and models. Our descriptions and comparisons of diverse habitat-quality metrics provide means for practitioners to overcome the modeling challenges associated with management or conservation of such highly mobile species. Whereas previous guidance for applying habitat-quality metrics has been scattered in diversified tracks of literature, we have brought this information together into an approachable format including accessible descriptions and a modeling case study for a typical example that conservation professionals can adapt for their own decision contexts and focal populations. Considerations for Resource Managers: Management objectives, proposed actions, data availability and quality, and model assumptions are all relevant considerations when applying and interpreting habitat-quality metrics. Graph-based metrics answer questions related to habitat centrality and connectivity, are suitable for populations with any movement pattern, quantify basic spatial and temporal patterns of occupancy and movement, and require the least data. Occupancy-based metrics answer questions about likelihood of persistence or colonization, are suitable for populations that undergo localized extinctions, quantify spatial and temporal patterns of occupancy and movement, and require a moderate amount of data. Demographic-based metrics answer questions about relative or absolute population size, are suitable for populations with any movement pattern, quantify demographic processes and population dynamics, and require the most data. More real-world examples applying occupancy-based, agent-based, and continuous-based metrics to seasonally migratory species are needed to better understand challenges and opportunities for applying these metrics more broadly.

The lifetime of individual cities includes periods of fast growth, slow growth and periods of shrinkage. There exists an extensive literature concerned with possible means to manage specific pathologies. It is our view that the design of specific policies should be the result of a comprehensive model of urban health. While not all cities go through the entire life cycle, a comprehensive theory of cities and specific policies need to include specification of the interaction of the various forces that shape the entire range of urban patterns and identification of specific combinations of values that create phase transitions among these patterns. To sort these ideas we suggest that there is a need to consider and incorporate the structure and timing of innovation activities, agglomeration effects that they generate, interurban migration patterns and assorted feedback mechanisms. We hypothesize that these flows depend on the activity rhythms of the various processes and their differential impact on cities.

The agents from census micro data are located in their rural origin with an empirical-estimated prior propensity to move. The population-scale social network is a hybrid one, combining observed family ties and locations of the origin with a parameter space calibrated from census, survey and aggregate data and sampled using a stepwise Latin Hypercube Sampling method. At monthly intervals, some agents migrate and these migratory acts change the social network by turning within-nonmigrant connections to between-migrant-nonmigrant connections, turning local connections to nonlocal connections, and adding among-migrant connections. In turn, the changing social network structure updates migratory propensities of those well-connected nonmigrants who become more likely to move. These two processes iterate over time. Using a core–periphery method developed from the k-core decomposition method, we identify and quantify the network structural changes and map these changes with the migration acceleration patterns.

The lack of targeted distribution of workers in a market economy requires the study of systemic processes in the labor market that lead to different dynamics of the number of employed in the sectors of the economy. In this case, personal strategies for choosing labor activity by economic agents become important. The presence of different strategies leads to the emergence of strata in the labor market with a dynamically changing number of employees, unevenly distributed among the sectors of the economy. As a result, non-linear fluctuations in the number of employed population can be observed, the toolkit of agent-based modeling is relevant for the study of the fluctuations. In the article, we examined in-phase and anti-phase fluctuations in the number of employees by economic activity on the example of the Jewish Autonomous Region in Russia. The fluctuations found in the time series of statistical data for 2008–2016. We show that such fluctuations appear by age groups of workers. In view of this, we put forward a hypothesis that the agent in the labor market chooses a place of work by a strategy, related with his age group. It directly affects the distribution of the number of employed for different cohorts and the total number of employed in the sectors of the economy. The agent determines the strategy taking into account the socio-economic characteristics of the branches of the economy (different levels of wages, working conditions, prestige of the profession). We construct a basic agent-oriented model of a three-branch economy to test the hypothesis. The model takes into account various strategies of economic agents, including the choice of the highest wages, the highest prestige of the profession and the best working conditions by the agent. As a result of numerical experiments, we show that the availability of various industry selection strategies and the age preferences of employers within the industry lead to periodic and complex dynamics of the number of different-aged employees. Age preferences may be a consequence, for example, the requirements of employer for the existence of work experience and education. Also, significant changes in the age structure of the employed population may result from migration. © 2018 Mihail Yu. Khavinson, Alexey N. Kolobov."

It causes the changes in migration flows and influences the socio-economic development of territories involved in the project. Preliminary assessment of the consequences of the implementation of similar projects requires the use of models. One of the modern directions of simulating is the agent-based approach. It allows to recreate a structure and behaviour of real socioeconomic systems in an artificial environment and to imitate their behaviour if external conditions change. The realism of the simulation of the main socio-economic processes determines the success of pursuing agent-based models to meet the challenges of forecasting. The article describes the construction of the agent-based model of the countries of Eurasia, imitating the basic processes of population movement in these countries, as well as the consequences of implementing large infrastructure projects as a result of the actions of many independent agents. There are two types of agents in the model: a) countries that are capable of lobbying for the implementation of profitable projects, and b) people who live in these countries, who create families, give birth to children and choose the type of activity and place of residence. In agents behaviour’s algorithm, we consider factors, revealed as a result of the research of actual migration processes in the countries of Eurasia. This has allowed to recreate in the model the imitation of people’s behaviour close to reality. The model construction was tested for two routes of New Silk Road. During the experiments, we monitored the changes of economic and demographic indicators for each participating country. Thus, for Russia the growth of total trade turnover (9.6 %) and net export (1.5 %) was observed. Participation in the project gave to China the growth 3.8 % and 7.7 %, respectively.

There are typically two approaches to modeling cell migration: either microscale, discrete or macroscale, continuum. The discrete approach, using agent-based models (ABMs), is typically stochastic and accounts for properties at the cell-scale. Conversely, the continuum approach, in which cell density is often modeled as a system of deterministic partial differential equations (PDEs), provides a global description of the migration at the population level. Deterministic models have the advantage that they are generally more amenable to mathematical analysis. They can lead to significant insights for situations in which the system comprises a large number of cells, at which point simulating a stochastic ABM becomes computationally expensive. However, finding an appropriate continuum model to describe the collective behavior of a system of individual cells can be a difficult task. Deterministic models are often specified on a phenomenological basis, which reduces their predictive power. Stochastic ABMs have advantages over their deterministic continuum counterparts. In particular, ABMs can represent individual-level behaviors (such as cell proliferation and cell–cell interaction) appropriately and are amenable to direct parameterization using experimental data. It is essential, therefore, to establish direct connections between stochastic microscale behaviors and deterministic macroscale dynamics. In this chapter we describe how, in some situations, these two distinct modeling approaches can be unified into a discrete-continuum equivalence framework. We carry out detailed examinations of a range of fundamental models of cell movement in one dimension. We then extend the discussion to more general models, which focus on incorporating other important factors that affect the migration of cells including cell proliferation and cell–cell interactions.

The Zika virus was first discovered in 1947. It was neglected until a major outbreak occurred on Yap Island, Micronesia, in 2007. Teratogenic effects resulting in microcephaly in newborn infants is the greatest public health threat. In 2016, the Zika virus epidemic was declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Consequently, mathematical models were constructed to explicitly elucidate related transmission dynamics. Survey Methodology. In this review article, two steps of journal article searching were performed. First, we attempted to identify mathematical models previously applied to the study of vector-borne diseases using the search terms ""dynamics,"" ""mathematical model,"" ""modeling,"" and ""vector-borne"" together with the names of vector-borne diseases including chikungunya, dengue, malaria, West Nile, and Zika. Then the identified types of model were further investigated. Second, we narrowed down our survey to focus on only Zika virus research. The terms we searched for were ""compartmental,"" ""spatial,"" ""metapopulation,"" ""network,"" ""individual-based,"" ""agent-based"" AND ""Zika."" All relevant studies were included regardless of the year of publication. We have collected research articles that were published before August 2017 based on our search criteria. In this publication survey, we explored the Google Scholar and PubMed databases. Results. We found five basic model architectures previously applied to vector-borne virus studies, particularly in Zika virus simulations. These include compartmental, spatial, metapopulation, network, and individual-based models. We found that Zika models carried out for early epidemics were mostly fit into compartmental structures and were less complicated compared to the more recent ones. Simple models are still commonly used for the timely assessment of epidemics. Nevertheless, due to the availability of large-scale real-world data and computational power, recently there has been growing interest in more complex modeling frameworks. Discussion. Mathematical models are employed to explore and predict how an infectious disease spreads in the real world, evaluate the disease importation risk, and assess the effectiveness of intervention strategies. As the trends in modeling of infectious diseases have been shifting towards data-driven approaches, simple and complex models should be exploited differently.

Cancer vaccines developed in the past have had limited success and the mechanisms resulting in failure are not well characterized. To elucidate these mechanisms, we developed a human-parametrized, in silico, agent-based model of vaccination-driven CTL activation within a clinical short-peptide vaccination context. The simulations predict a sharp transition in the probability of CTL activation, which occurs with variation in the separation rate (or off-rate) of tumour-specific immune response-inducing peptides (cognate antigen) from the major histocompatibility class I (MHC-I) receptors of dendritic cells (DCs) originally at the vaccination site. For peptides with MHC-I off-rates beyond this transition, it is predicted that no vaccination strategy will lead to successful expansion of CTLs. For slower off-rates, below the transition, the probability of CTL activation becomes sensitive to the numbers of DCs and T cells that interact subsequent to DC migration to the draining lymph node of the vaccination site. Thus, the off-rate is a key determinant of vaccine design. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved."

Computational modeling may help to unfold the role of multiple evolving factors that exist and interact in the tumor microenvironment. Understanding these complex multiscale interactions is a crucial step toward predicting cancer growth and in developing effective therapies. We integrate different modeling approaches in a multiscale, avascular, hybrid tumor growth model encompassing tissue, cell, and sub-cell scales. At the tissue level, we consider the dispersion of nutrients and growth factors in the tumor microenvironment, which are modeled through reaction-diffusion equations. At the cell level, we use an agent-based model (ABM) to describe normal and tumor cell dynamics, with normal cells kept in homeostasis and cancer cells differentiated into quiescent, proliferative, migratory, apoptotic, hypoxic, and necrotic states. Cell movement is driven by the balance of a variety of forces according to Newton's second law, including those related to growth-induced stresses. Phenotypic transitions are defined by specific rule of behaviors that depend on microenvironment stimuli.We integrate in each cell/agent a branch of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway. This pathway is modeled by a system of coupled nonlinear differential equations involving the mass laws of 20 molecules. The rates of change in the concentration of some key molecules trigger proliferation or migration advantage response. The bridge between cell and tissue scales is built through the reaction and source terms of the partial differential equations. Our hybrid model is built in a modular way, enabling the investigation of the role of different mechanisms at multiple scales on tumor progression. This strategy allows representing both the collective behavior due to cell assembly as well as microscopic intracellular phenomena described by signal transduction pathways. Here, we investigate the impact of some mechanisms associated with sustained proliferation on cancer progression. Specifically, we focus on the intracellular proliferation/migration-Advantage-response driven by the EGFR pathway and on proliferation inhibition due to accumulation of growthinduced stresses. Simulations demonstrate that the model can adequately describe some complex mechanisms of tumor dynamics, including growth arrest in avascular tumors. Both the sub-cell model and growth-induced stresses give rise to heterogeneity in the tumor expansion and a rich variety of tumor behaviors."

The method is growing in use in zoology and ecology. Evolutionary principles may be merged with an agent-based modeling perspective to have individual animals or other agents compete. Four main categories are discussed: genetic algorithms, evolutionary programming, genetic programming, and evolutionary strategies. In evolutionary computation, a population is represented in a way that allows for an objective function to be assessed that is relevant to the problem of interest. The poorest performing members are removed from the population, and remaining members reproduce and may be mutated. The fitness of the members is again assessed, and the cycle continues until a stopping condition is met. Case studies include optimizing: egg shape given different clutch sizes, mate selection, migration of wildebeest, birds, and elk, vulture foraging behavior, algal bloom prediction, and species richness given energy constraints. Other case studies simulate the evolution of species and a means to project shifts in species ranges in response to a changing climate that includes competition and phenotypic plasticity. This introduction concludes by citing other uses of evolutionary computation and a review of the flexibility of the methods. For example, representing species' niche spaces subject to selective pressure allows studies on cladistics, the taxon cycle, neutral versus niche paradigms, fundamental versus realized niches, community structure and order of colonization, invasiveness, and responses to a changing climate. © The Author (2017).

As a response to climate change impacts in island communities, such as sea level rise, discounting the future can be a rational response due to increased stress on natural resources and uncertainty about whether future generations will have the same access to the same resources. By incorporating systematic responses of discount rates into models of resource conservation, realistic expectations of future human responses to climate change and associated resource stress may be developed. This paper illustrates the importance of time discounting through a theoretical agent-based model of resource use in island communities. A discount rate change can dramatically change projections about future migration and community-based conservation efforts. Our simulation results show that an increase in discount rates due to a credible information shock about future climate change impacts is likely to speed resource depletion. The negative impacts of climate change are therefore likely to be underestimated if changes in discount rates and emerging migration patterns are not taken into account. © Copyright Foundation for Environmental Conservation 2017."

In a spatial environment, with multiple locations with independent but inter-connected markets, these transitions quickly become complex and highly non-linear due to the feedback loops between the micro individual-level decisions and the meso location-wise market decisions. To capture these continuously evolving micro–meso interactions, this paper presents a spatially explicit bottom-up agent-based model to analyze natural disaster-like shocks to low-income regions. The aim of the model is to temporally and spatially track how population distributions, income, and consumption levels evolve, in order to identify low-income workers that are “food insecure”. The model is applied to the 2005 earthquake in northern Pakistan, which faced catastrophic losses and high levels of displacement in a short time span, and with market disruptions, resulted in high levels of food insecurity. The model is calibrated to pre-crisis trends, and shocked using distance-based output and labor loss functions to replicate the earthquake impact. Model results show, how various factors like existing income and saving levels, distance from the fault line, and connectivity to other locations, can give insights into the spatial and temporal emergence of vulnerabilities. The simulation framework presented here, leaps beyond existing modeling efforts, which usually deals with macro long-term loss estimates, and allows policy makers to come up with informed short-term policies in an environment where data is non-existent, policy response is time dependent, and resources are limited. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Our approach adds to the toolkit of demographic projection by allowing for shocks and social influence, which alter behaviour in non-linear ways, while sticking to the general framework of multistate modelling.

Central concepts, such as behaviour conditional on agent attributes, age-dependent behaviour, and stochastic waiting times, are tightly integrated in the language. Thereby, alternative decisions are modelled by concurrent processes that compete by stochastic race.

Traditionally, policy makers have concentrated on population control strategies by focussing on birth rates and rural–urban migration to stem the growth and emergence of slums. However, these strategies have often failed to achieve the desired results. In the present paper we find the key underlying processes that explains the observed differences in household life cycle between slum and non-slum households. We find that the slum households when compared to nonslum urban households, exhibit a large variation in the household size over the course of their life cycle, which in turn leads to inefficiency while building slum resettlement colonies. We have developed an agent based model, namely DynaSlum, to identify the key social determinants that impact the behaviour of a slum household. We use a novel and unique dataset based on the field work from 37 slums in Bangalore combined with the NFHS data to calibrate DynaSlum and validate our findings. This paper presents two major insights to address the challenges. First, we find that high rate of home leaving among young adults is the key determinants for the large variation in the life cycle of slum households. Second, we show that reducing home leaving among young adults will reduce the formation number of new slum households and contribute to a higher but stable household size. This will lead to efficiency and higher per capita resource consumption when building capacity for slum development (resettlement colonies) as policy makers would be able to plan for a stable household size. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Integrated particle system (IPS) models are a form of stochastic model that take spatial distributions, environmental factors, and agent migration into consideration. Unlike agent based models (ABM), IPS models only rely on a set of general reactions to describe the interactions of molecules/entities, allowing for an easy cause-effect connection between macroscopic phenomena and microscopic behavior. However, IPS models currently do not track individual agents or apply manipulations to individual agent behavior based on their specific location or their individual history. Therefore, IPS models cannot incorporate agent-based manipulations and tracking while still relying on a set of basic assumptions that are needed to easily connect emergent phenomena to simplistic microscopic behaviors. Here we propose an IPS modeling framework where we convert the exact Gillespie algorithm into a 2 dimensional lattice space that allows for environmental factors where molecules can move stochastically, generating an overall heterogeneous molecule distribution. Individual molecules can be tracked without describing the rules of interaction for each specific individual molecule, forming a tracked IPS (TIPS) modeling framework. However, since each individual molecule is tagged, agent-based manipulations and the ability to alter agent behavior due to history can be incorporated into TIPS, allowing one to model biological systems that would otherwise have to rely on a pure ABM. We apply the TIPS modeling framework to STIM1(stromal interaction molecule 1)-Orai1(calcium release-activated calcium channel protein 1) binding and motion, in T cells as a result of T cell receptor activation a key component of the calcium response within lymphocytes that leads to the adaptive response of T cells in an immune response. Within this biological setting we show that observed patterns of reduced motion following activation can be explained by a diffusion trap coming from changes in the environment of interaction without any real change in the molecules movement rates. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"

However, a comprehensive mechanobiological model to capture these spatiotemporal events and predict the growth and remodeling of an atherosclerotic artery is still lacking. Here, we present a multiscale model of leukocyte TEM and plaque evolution in the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. The approach integrates cellular behaviors via agent-based modeling (ABM) and hemodynamic effects via computational fluid dynamics (CFD). In this computational framework, the ABM implements the diffusion kinetics of key biological proteins, namely Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL), Tissue Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α), Interlukin-10 (IL-10) and Interlukin-1 beta (IL-1β), to predict chemotactic driven leukocyte migration into and within the artery wall. The ABM also considers wall shear stress (WSS) dependent leukocyte TEM and compensatory arterial remodeling obeying Glagov’s phenomenon. Interestingly, using fully developed steady blood flow does not result in a representative number of leukocyte TEM as compared to pulsatile flow, whereas passing WSS at peak systole of the pulsatile flow waveform does. Moreover, using the model, we have found leukocyte TEM increases monotonically with decreases in luminal volume. At critical plaque shapes the WSS changes rapidly resulting in sudden increases in leukocyte TEM suggesting lumen volumes that will give rise to rapid plaque growth rates if left untreated. Overall this multi-scale and multi-physics approach appropriately captures and integrates the spatiotemporal events occurring at the cellular level in order to predict leukocyte transmigration and plaque evolution. © 2017 Bhui, Hayenga."

Recent changes in stock structures, conditions and stock mixing between eastern and western Baltic cod can jeopardize the reliability of stock assessments and of the fishery economy. We modelled how different management, individual vessel decision-making, and stock growth and mixing scenarios have induced alternative individual vessel spatial effort allocation and economic performance by affecting fishing costs and by changing the relative stock abundance and size distribution. Stock mixing heavily influences profit and stock abundance for stocks that have experienced increased fishing mortality (F) levels. Western cod F has increased from a higher total allowed catches (TAC) advised in the medium-term due to the westward migration of eastern cod while eastern cod F has increased from reduced growth in the east. Greater pressures on western cod and decreased eastern cod growth and conditions greatly reduce the overall cod spawning stock biomass, thus changing the landing size composition and associated fishery profits. As a cumulative effect, fishing efforts are redirected towards western areas depending on management (quotas). However, total profits are less affected when traditional fishing opportunities and switching possibilities for other species and areas are maintained. Our evaluation indicates that current management mechanisms cannot correct for potential detrimental effects on cod fisheries when effort re-allocation changes landing origins. By investigating different economic starting conditions we further show that Baltic cod mis-management could have resulted in unintended unequal (skewed) impacts and serious consequences for certain fleets and fishing communities compared with others. Our management strategy evaluation is instrumental in capturing non-linear effects of different recommendations on sustainability and economic viability, and we show that fixed F-values management is likely not an attainable or sufficient goal in ensuring the sustainability and viability of fisheries and stocks given changing biological conditions. © International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2017.

In this study, a coupled hydrodynamic and agent-based approach is developed to characterise the transport behaviour of colony-forming Microcystis in a large shallow lake. Two models are combined: a hydrodynamic model to offer a basic flow field, and an agent-based model to incorporate the physiological response (buoyancy-controlling strategies) and migratory behaviour (horizontal advection and random-walk vertical mixing) of Micorcystis. The Meiliang Bay in Lake Taihu, which experiences high Microcystis blooms every year, was chosen as a case study to test the performance of this coupled approach. By comparing our coupled model with available field measurement, our results can reproduce changes in buoyancy status and three-dimensional distribution exposures to different wind intensities. Meanwhile, our coupled model shows more accurate results than the simulated results from traditional Eulerian approach. In shallow lake systems, strong wind (>6 m/s) can easily mix water column and keep most colonies buoyant. Subsequent gentle wind (<3 m/s) causes more intensive horizontal accumulation of these buoyant Microcystis in the downwind area than what happens under strong wind. Small colonies are readily dispersed by wind-induced turbulence and homogenized by local current circumstances. Diurnal temporary stratification and large colony sizes contribute to surface patches formation and downwind migration, leading to the heterogeneity of Microcystis bloom under the integrated effect of surface currents and wind drift. Therefore, the transport pattern of Microcystis colonies is a dynamic balance between turbulence and wind drift, along with buoyancy which is related to colony size. Overall, our combined model could be used to characterise the detailed movement patterns of Microcystis colonies or patches in large shallow lakes. © 2016"

Despite the overall national reduction in crime, Chicago's crime is still double the national average. And in the past year, Chicago's murder rate has been the worst since 1997. Therefore, methods of analyzing complex systems have become essential in predicting crime behavior and movement. Moreover, the interaction between criminals and their living environment, the correlation with the migration of people, and various circumstantial drivers are considered in building the model. The designed ABM will be validated by simulating various experimental scenarios, and comparing the results. From observing patterns across location, time, and crime type, behavior rules and individual adapting properties are determined by using the micro sequential rules. Ideally, the model will be valid, simple, and robust. In the end, a crime spread algorithm is proposed, which has the potential to be implemented to develop practical crime-prevention plans."

A brief review and analysis of agent-based migration models presented in the foreign literature are given. The agent-based model of labour migration from China to Russia developed by the Central Economic Mathematical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences simulates human behaviour close to reality, which is based on their internal purposes, determining the agents choice of territory as a place of residence. Therefore, at the development of the agents of the model and their behaviour algorithms, as well as the organization of the environment in which they exist and interact, the main characteristics of the population of two neighbouring countries and their demographic processes have been considered. Using the model, two experiments have been conducted. The purpose of the first of them was to assess the effect of depreciation of the rubble against the yuan on the overall indexes of labour migration, as well as its structure. In the second experiment, the procedure of the search of the information by agents for the migratory decision-making was changing.

Using an algorithm based on attitude shifts, we developed a theoretical model to represent identity shifts among long-term encamped refugees. Findings from the simulation indicate that refugees, due to the limited types of interactions they may encounter when confined to a camp, may experience identity shifts away from that of their home country, as well as away from territorial nationality.

Yet key features of this process remain poorly understood, particularly how social behaviors intersected with demographic drivers to create the patterns of genomic diversity observed across Island Southeast Asia today. Such questions are ripe for computer modeling. Here, we construct an agent-based model to simulate human mobility across Island Southeast Asia from the Neolithic period to the present, with a special focus on interactions between individuals with Asian, Papuan, and mixed Asian-Papuan ancestry. Incorporating key features of the region, including its complex geography (islands and sea), demographic drivers (fecundity and migration), and social behaviors (marriage preferences), the model simultaneously tracks a full suite of genomic markers (autosomes, X chromosome, mitochondrial DNA, and Y chromosome). Using Bayesian inference, model parameters were determined that produce simulations that closely resemble the admixture profiles of 2299 individuals from 84 populations across Island Southeast Asia. The results highlight that greater propensity to migrate and elevated birth rates are related drivers behind the expansion of individuals with Asian ancestry relative to individuals with Papuan ancestry, that offspring preferentially resulted from marriages between Asian women and Papuan men, and that in contrast to current thinking, individuals with Asian ancestry were likely distributed across large parts of western Island Southeast Asia before the Neolithic expansion. © 2016 Vallée et al."

This study develops an agent-based model to simulate social and economic influences on neighborhood choice. With Danville, Illinois, as an empirical context, a pattern-oriented approach is employed to examine the role of social ties in shaping intraurban household mobility. In the model, household agents decide whether and where to relocate within the community based on factors such as neighborhood attractiveness, affordability, and the density of a household's social network in the prospective block group. Social network and neighborhood choices are encoded with logit utility functions. The relative influence of factors affecting the formation of social ties in the simulated social network, such as geographic proximity, similarity of income, race, and presence of children, are adjusted using parameter variation to create alternative model settings. Simulated migration patterns resulting from different network and neighborhood choice coefficients are compared with observed migration patterns over a two-year period. Based on 1,000 simulation experiments, a regression of homeowner migration error (the difference between simulated and observed migration) relative to the parameter settings revealed components of social network choice such as income, race, and probability of local ties to be significant in matching observed migration patterns. A nonlinear effect of simulated social networks on household mobility and thus migration error was exhibited in this study. © 2016 Taylor & Francis. All rights reserved."

Disaster management organizations (DMOs) are expected to contribute to ensuring this protection. However, what happens when their resources to cope with a flood are at stake or the intensity and frequency of the event exceeds their capacities? Many cities in the Free State of Saxony, Germany, were strongly hit by several floods in the last years and are additionally challenged by demographic change, with an ageing society and out-migration leading to population shrinkage in many parts of Saxony. Disaster management, which is mostly volunteer-based in Germany, is particularly affected by this change, leading to a loss of members. We propose an agent-based simulation model that acts as a ""virtual lab"" to explore the impact of various changes on disaster management performance. Using different scenarios we examine the impact of changes in personal resources of DMOs, their access to operation relevant information, flood characteristics as well as differences between geographic regions. A loss of DMOs and associated manpower caused by demographic change has the most profound impact on the performance.

Accordingly, a spatially-explicit agent-based ecological modeling, parallel simulation, and analysis environment called SEARUMS has been developed. However, the conservatively synchronized parallel simulation infrastructure of SEARUMS did not scale effectively. Furthermore, the initial multithreaded shared-memory design prevented utilization of resources on multiple compute nodes of a distributed memory cluster. Consequently, the simulation infrastructure of SEARUMS was redesigned to operate as a Time Warp synchronized parallel and distributed discrete event simulation (PDES) on modern distributed-memory supercomputing platforms. The new PDES environment is called SEARUMS++. The spatially-explicit nature of the models posed several challenges in achieving scalable and efficient PDES, necessitating new approaches in SEARUMS++ for: 1 modeling spatial interactions and initial partitioning of agents, 2 logical migration of an agent during simulation using proxy agents to reflect migratory characteristics, and 3 ghosting of agents using multiple proxy agents to handle boundary cases that occur during logical migration of agents. This article presents our optimization efforts involving new methods to address aforementioned challenges. The design of SEARUMS++ and experimental evaluation of various alternatives that were explored to achieve scalable and efficient PDES are also discussed. Our experiments indicate that SEARUMS++ provides 200% performance improvement and maintains scalability to a larger number of processors, thus enabling efficient parallel simulation of spatially-explicit agent-based epidemiological models. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This study used ABM to simulate human land use in the study area over a period of 15 years under different management scenarios and assessed the impact on future suitability and functional connectivity of CRG habitat. The simulations showed that a landscape approach with greater focus on interventions to change human behaviour towards conserving gorillas and sustainable forest use would result in greater improvement in habitat suitability and functional connectivity compared to focusing on improving law enforcement within existing protected areas. However, the best scenarios were when both law enforcement and behaviour change increased.

We disentangle the relative contribution of specific river properties to observed patterns of genetic variation by evaluating how different branching architectures and downstream flow regimes affect the genetic structure of populations situated within river networks. Irrespective of the river length, our results illustrate that the extent of river branching, confluence position, and levels of asymmetric downstream migration dictate patterns of genetic variation in riverine populations. Comparisons between simple and highly branched rivers show a 20-fold increase in the overall genetic diversity and a sevenfold increase in the genetic differentiation between local populations.

We also discuss two challenges that hamper the widespread use of ABM in the study of migration and, more broadly, demography and the social sciences: (a) the choice and the operationalisation of a behavioural theory (decision-making and social interaction) and (b) the selection of empirical evidence to validate the model. We offer advice on how these challenges might be overcome. © 2016, The Author(s)."

Optimal foraging theory predicts that such animals should spend more time in patches that enable them to maximise the net rate of energy and nutrient gain. The type of search strategy employed by animals is, however, expected to depend on the amount of information that is involved in the search process. In highly dynamic landscapes, animals are unlikely to have complete knowledge about the distribution of the resources, which makes them unable to forage on the patches that enable them to maximise their net energy intake. Random search may, however, be a good strategy in landscapes where patches with profitable resources are abundant. We present simulation experiments using an individual-based model (IBM) to test which foraging decision rule (FDR) best reproduces the population patterns observed in pink-footed geese during spring staging in an agricultural landscape in Mid-Norway. Our results suggested that while geese employed a random search strategy, they were also able to individually learn where the most profitable patches were located and return to the patches that resulted in highest energy intake. Such asocial learning is rarely reported for flock animals. The modelled geese did not benefit from group foraging, which contradicts the results reported by most studies on flocking birds. Geese also did not possess complete knowledge about the profitability of the available habitat. Most likely, there is no one single optimal foraging strategy for capital breeders but such strategy is site and species-specific. We discussed the potential use of the model as a valuable tool for making future risk assessments of human disturbance and changes in agricultural practices. © 2015 The Authors."

As a result of wars, insurgencies, political persecution, complex emergencies, and climate change, more than 65 million people worldwide are considered as forcibly displaced. This rising number has created significant challenges for humanitarian agencies. Therefore, understanding the causes, movement patterns, and migration flows of displaced populations has attracted researchers. While traditional migration models can be used, more sophisticated and advanced models are required to capture various factors influencing the displacement process and the complex interactions and behaviour of various agents that force people to make displacement decisions. Agent-based modeling (ABM) has emerged as a preferred modeling method for complex social and environmental problems including forced displacement and migration. ABM in the context of forced migration allows for a more accurate and detailed simulation by including dynamic interactions of migrants and humanitarian actors. This paper presents an agent-based model developed to understand the nature of forced displacement in Iraq caused by recent conflicts."

With conventional treatment, the median survival time is typically 3â€""4 years, although it can be extended to 5â€""7 years or longer with advanced treatments. Recent research indicated that an increase in osteoclast (OC) activity is often associated withmultiple myeloma (MM) and that a decrease inosteoblast (OB) activity contributesto the osteolytic lesions in MM. Normally, the populations of OCs and OBs are inequilibrium, and an imbalance in this statecontributes to the development of lesions. Research procedures A multi-scale agent-based multiple myeloma model was developed to simulate the proliferation, migration and death of OBs and OCs. Subsequently, this model was employed to investigate the efficacy of thethree most commonly used drugs for MM treatment under the following two premises: the reduction in the progression of MM and the re-establishment of the equilibrium between OCs and OBs. Research purposes The simulated results not only demonstrated the capacity of the model to choose optimal combinations of the drugs but also showed that the optimal use of the three drugs can restore the balance between OCs and OBs as well as kill MMs. Furthermore, the drug synergism analysis function of the model revealed that restoring the balance between OBs and OCs can significantly increase the efficacy of drugs against tumor cells. © 2015 Qiao et al.

To determine the mechanism behind clustering, we used experimental and computational modeling to determine the individual contributions of long-range and short-range interactions. Experimentally, the migration of PANC-1 cells on tissue culture treated plastic was tracked by time-lapse microscopy with or without a central cluster of cells that could act as a concentrated source of some long-range signal. Cell migration data was analyzed in terms of distance, number of steps, and migration rate in each direction, as well as migration rate as a function of distance from the cluster.

This model captures the essence of neurogenesis by incorporating the neural stem cells, rapidly proliferating intermediate cells and the neurons. It also captures radial dispersion of neurons into the olfactory bulb. Our model incorporates stem cell death (apoptosis) over certain number of stem cell divisions resulting into reduction in the generation of neurons with time, which mimics aging.

The aim of the modeling is to provide a simple model that corroborates quantitatively the experiments, without considering the complex phenomena inherent to cell migration.

Raptor behavior and demography are especially difficult to monitor, but models of movement can provide information toward this goal. The golden eagle (. Aquila chrysaetos) in eastern North America is an apex predator of regional conservation concern, and little is known about its population ecology, movements, or behavior. We designed an agent-based model to simulate autumn migration of eagles in Pennsylvania, USA. Inputs to the model included information on regional topography, known flight behaviors (i.e. slope-soaring and thermal-soaring and gliding), estimated uplift, and a principal axis of migration. In total, we modeled 6094 flight routes, averaging 2191 (±1281; ±SD; range: 3-5373) moves. Simulations were spatially comparable to historic flight route data collected via telemetry and generally followed topography that provided uplift. In our model, orographic uplift available to migrant eagles was stronger and more frequent than thermal uplift, and uplift forms were not correlated with one another (. r=. -0.145). Modeled golden eagle migration in autumn follows a narrow-front pattern as individuals are concentrated in areas that produce orographic uplift. Simulated flights were more concentrated on days when historic counts of golden eagles were high at monitoring sites. In contrast, simulations were more dispersed on days when fewer actual eagles were recorded. We used output from our simulations to select new sites that could be used for monitoring migratory raptors. Relatively large numbers of golden eagles were observed at these sites, thus validating performance of our model.

This approach can be subjected to strong criticism as substantial aspects of the biological system being captured are not currently known, meaning assumptions need to be made that could have a critical impact on simulation response. We have utilised the CoSMoS process in the development of an agent-based simulation of the formation of Peyer’s patches (PP), gut-associated lymphoid organs that have a key role in the initiation of adaptive immune responses to infection. Although the use of genetic tools, imaging technologies and ex vivo culture systems has provided significant insight into the cellular components and associated pathways involved in PP development, interesting questions remain that cannot be addressed using these approaches, and as such well justified assumptions have been introduced into our model to counter this. Here we focus not on the development of the model itself, but instead demonstrate how the resultant simulation can be used to assess how these assumptions impact the simulation response. For example, we consider the impact of our assumption that the migration rate of lymphoid tissue cells into the gut remains constant throughout PP development. We demonstrate that an analysis of the assumptions made in the construction of the domain model may either increase confidence in the model as a representation of the biological system it captures, or may suggest areas where further biological experimentation is required. © 2014, The Author(s)."

Guidance regarding the relevance of the CUE from the upper echelons of Defence with Chief of Army endorsement, can be found in the Modernisation and Strategic Planning Division Staff's Future Land Warfare Report (FLWR) (MSPD-Staff, 2014), and in Kilcullen's (2014) “The Australian Army in the Urban Networked Littoral”. Both echo a similar message that future military operations are most likely to be held in highly networked littoral CUE, where the degree of complexity of such environments is far beyond that of conventional force-on-force engagement. With regard to the operating environment FLWR (MSPD-Staff, 2014) indicates that the environment for future operations has five meta-trends; crowded, connected, lethal, collective, constrained. The term 'crowded' encompasses a range of factors that interplay to create complex human, informational and urban physical terrain, including urbanisation, rural to urban migration, population growth, resource scarcity and environmental and regional political instability. The term 'connected' refers to the flattening effect of the interconnected global economic, social and communications systems. It is Kilcullen's (2014) seminal observation, that the central novel feature is the highly networked nature of the urban world, which encompasses complex flow systems of trade, people, idea-systems, information with competition for not only territory, consisting of the natural land and built environs, but the built environment services such as, water, electricity, transportation, communication and the like. The competition does not, however, stop there; it is also a competition for idea-systems in what some have called the “battle for ideas” (Clarke, 2004). Many interrelated factors contribute toward population movements toward littoral mega-cities, upon whose physical terrain, exist turbulent seas of complex flowing dynamic topologies which we term the human-terrain. This discussion paper attempts to start an exploration of the issues involved in studying violent conflict in the uncertain complex CUE. A small multi-disciplinary-team has been formed within LD and JOAD with an initial focus on the Knowledge Representation (KR) of littoral urban environments for highly networked actors within an Agent Based Model (ABM) and other simulations. We suggest, based on previous work of Johnson and Ivancevic (2013; 2015), two psychological constructs which may well be applicable to ABM for either beauty of KR or computational efficiency. The current work is being conducted as a horizon survey within the frame of unbounded systems thinking (UST) due to Mitroff and Linstone (1993). With regard to world views, in addition to the traditional perspective of science/technology, the Technical T perspective, two other perspectives are taken into account in deciding what action to take next. They are the Organisational O perspective of the social-entity and the Personal P perspective of the self/individuation. It is a challenging approach in which everything is connected to everything and none of the sciences or professions involved in a study is considered fundamental. Against this frame the sociological stance is considered at some length and seven basic aspects of sociological theory are introduced (Macionis and Gerber, 2010); culture, society, socialisation, social interaction in everyday life, groups and organisations, sexuality and society and finally deviance. We recommend that in highly networked urban environment that the sociology discipline be considered for modelling social-interactions, including emotions and language, within and between various social-groups for studies of future military operations within CUE. Finally, some difficult questions, from a UST point of view, are raised for using ABMs with respect to making progress towards defence outcomes. © 2020 Proceedings - 21st International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2015.

Exploring how the built environment might change over time is an essential element for assessing changing risks. This chapter presents and discusses two algorithm-based approaches used in the Tyndall Coastal Simulator to analyse local changes in residential and other urban land uses. The first approach uses multi-criteria analysis (MCA) to calculate spatial weights based on a number of attracting features such as transport, existing development, flood risk and proximity to the coast to identify the development patterns under different socio-economic futures. The second method uses agent-based modelling (ABM) to examine interactions between residential households and local planners as a demand–supply process that produces possible development patterns under different socio-economic futures. The core elements of this model are the location preferences of (changing) individual residential agents and the constraints imposed by planners through land-use policy. The MCA method is simpler than the ABM method and useful for developing and realising socio-economic scenarios because of its flexibility and the possibility of quick implementation and adjustment. As a result, the MCA method is easy to implement, and it provides flexible tools that can be used for first-step socio-economic scenario development. While the MCA method requires fewer input variables, the ABM method is better able to account for feedbacks between governance processes, individual choices and external changes such as migration. The ABM is more sophisticated and more detailed and so provides a comprehensive approach that considers both location preferences and planning policies. The ABM method captures local behaviour and the iterative characteristics of urban dynamics. For both models, the key outputs are plausible distributions (scenarios) of urban dwellings in East Anglia over the twenty-first century under four different socio-economic storylines (see also Appendix A). Both methods are relevant to the process of risk assessment of climate change, and both have much scope for improvement, e.g. including brownfield sites and change in vertical as well as horizontal urban densities. For the Tyndall Coastal Simulator, these model outputs provide the distribution of property that is vulnerable to coastal erosion and flooding, as described in the risk analysis in Chap. 9. More generally these types of algorithm-based models of socio-economic parameters have great potential for inclusion in a wide range of future change analyses. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."

Housing location decision making is a complex process driven by the interactions between the housing market and home searchers. Researchers have paid much attention to the environmental, socioeconomic, cultural, and policy features of housing markets. In contrast, housing search has been relatively neglected due to challenges of theory, methodology, and data. This article addresses these challenges by presenting an agent-based model of intraurban migration featuring straightforward and empirically specified rules for housing search. This model is calibrated and validated against real-world housing vacancies and relocation origin–destination pairs extracted from parcel records for the Twin Cities of Minnesota, USA, for 2005–2007. Drawing on these unique data sidesteps a long-standing issue, the prohibitive costs of identifying, recording, and quantifying housing search activities for an entire metropolitan region. Conceptually, this model updates geographic theories of intraurban migration that focus on intervening opportunities and spatial bias.

Successful mitigation of epidemics requires coordinated, well-planned intervention strategies that are specific to the pathogen, transmission modality, population, and available resources. Modeling and simulation in the field of computational epidemiology provides predictions of expected outcomes that are used by public policy planners in setting response strategies. Developing up to date models of population structures, daily activities, and movement has proven challenging for developing countries due to limited governmental resources. Recent collaborations (in 2012 and 2014) with telecom providers have given public health researchers access to Big Data needed to build high-fidelity models. Researchers now have access to billions of anonymized, detailed call data records (CDR) of mobile devices for several West African countries. In addition to official census records, these CDR datasets provide insights into the actual population locations, densities, movement, travel patterns, and migration in hard to reach areas. These datasets allow for the construction of population, activity, and movement models. For the first time, these models provide computational support of health related decision making in these developing areas (via simulation-based studies). New models, datasets, and simulation software were produced to assist in mitigating the continuing outbreak of Ebola. Existing models of disease characteristics, propagation, and progression were updated for the current circulating strain of Ebola. The simulation process required the interactions of multi-scale models, including viral loads (at the cellular level), disease progression (at the individual person level), disease propagation (at the workplace and family level), societal changes in migration and travel movements (at the population level), and mitigating interventions (at the abstract governmental policy level). The predictive results from this system were validated against results from the CDC's high-level predictions. © The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V."

The early immune response in human blood comprises the elimination of pathogens by antimicrobial peptides and innate immune cells, such as neutrophils or monocytes. Mathematical modeling is a predictive method to examine these complex processes and to quantify the dynamics of pathogen-host interactions. Since model parameters are often not directly accessible from experiment, their estimation is required by calibrating model predictions with experimental data. Depending on the complexity of the mathematical model, parameter estimation can be associated with excessively high computational costs in terms of run time and memory. We apply a strategy for reliable parameter estimation where different modeling approaches with increasing complexity are used that build on one another. This bottom-up modeling approach is applied to an experimental human whole-blood infection assay for Candida albicans. Aiming for the quantification of the relative impact of different routes of the immune response against this human-pathogenic fungus, we start from a non-spatial state-based model (SBM), because this level of model complexity allows estimating a priori unknown transition rates between various system states by the global optimization method simulated annealing. Building on the non-spatial SBM, an agent-based model (ABM) is implemented that incorporates the migration of interacting cells in three-dimensional space. The ABM takes advantage of estimated parameters from the non-spatial SBM, leading to a decreased dimensionality of the parameter space. This space can be scanned using a local optimization approach, i.e., least-squares error estimation based on an adaptive regular grid search, to predict cell migration parameters that are not accessible in experiment. In the future, spatio-temporal simulations of whole-blood samples may enable timely stratification of sepsis patients by distinguishing hyper-inflammatory from paralytic phases in immune dysregulation. © 2015 Lehnert, Timme, Pollmächer, Hünniger, Kurzai and Figge."

In the lung, it is able to quickly adapt to the humid environment and, if not removed within a time frame of 4-8 h, the pathogen may cause damage by germination and invasive growth. Applying a to-scale agent-based model of human alveoli to simulate early A. fumigatus infection under physiological conditions, we recently demonstrated that alveolar macrophages require chemotactic cues to accomplish the task of pathogen detection within the aforementioned time frame. The objective of this study is to specify our general prediction on the as yet unidentified chemokine by a quantitative analysis of its expected properties, such as the diffusion coefficient and the rates of secretion and degradation. To this end, the rule-based implementation of chemokine diffusion in the initial agent-based model is revised by numerically solving the spatio-temporal reaction-diffusion equation in the complex structure of the alveolus. In this hybrid agent-based model, alveolar macrophages are represented as migrating agents that are coupled to the interactive layer of diffusing molecule concentrations by the kinetics of chemokine receptor binding, internalization and re-expression. Performing simulations for more than a million virtual infection scenarios, we find that the ratio of secretion rate to the diffusion coefficient is the main indicator for the success of pathogen detection. Moreover, a subdivision of the parameter space into regimes of successful and unsuccessful parameter combination by this ratio is specific for values of the migration speed and the directional persistence time of alveolar macrophages, but depends only weakly on chemokine degradation rates. © 2015 Pollmächer and Figge."

Sistemas Informáticos y Computación, Universidad Politécnica de Valencia, Valencia, 46022, Spain","The aim of this study is to build a computational model to simulate border crossing. Since the 19th century, many theories have been applied to the study of international migration phenomena. These theories cover sociological, economical, and cultural aspects. All the theories aim at estimating the magnitude of population movements. Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are presented as a new methodological approach to model and foresee the process of migration. This article discusses how legal aspects can also be treated from a computational point of view. When a migrant reaches the border checkpoint, he/she must deal with the legislation of the destination country, which is applied by the border security police. This interaction at the microlevel between the migrant and the border agent is based on the definition of a behavioral model that includes the migrant's profile, the border officer's profile, and the legislation that rules the border crossing. With this model, the effects at the macrolevel of new policies (which are usually difficult to predict) can be estimated. Changes in legislation or in strictness in applying the existing law at certain borders can influence migration trends; for example, the choice of route. This study presents the main features of the computational model that has been developed to recreate the border-crossing scenario in a Multi-Agent System. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Here, we investigate stem cell seeding to an avascular tumour site using an agent-based stochastic model of breast cancer metastatic seeding. The model includes several important cellular features such as stem cell symmetric and asymmetric division, migration, cellular quiescence, senescence, apoptosis and cell division cycles. It also includes external features such as stem cell seeding frequency and location. Using this model, we find that cell seeding rate and location are important features for tumour growth.

Several modeling paradigms can be used to describe system behavior. Agent-based modeling provides an efficient and powerful environment to represent characteristics at organ, cellular, and subcellular levels, enables interactions of various components of a system based on events triggered during a simulation, and tracks dynamic information of individual entities. Agents are individual building blocks that are capable of performing various actions independently based on both their own perception of their environment, and the quantitative and qualitative rules that govern their behavior. Three-dimensional tissue engineering where angiogenesis and tissue growth occur in a scaffold illustrates agent-based modeling and its use for supervision of tissue growth, prediction of the final tissue properties, and regulation of the growth process for the desired final tissue. Time series models offer an alternative modeling paradigm and generate input-output (blackbox) models that have been successful in supervision and control of complex processes.

The primary purpose of this paper is to examine the development and evolution of China's spatial structure under different traffic systems and its influence on the regional economy and interactions, such as technology diffusion and capital flow. This information is important because we need to explore various measures to improve the imbalanced economic development in China. In this study, unlike in previous structure researches, an agent-based dynamic regional economic model is built from the perspective of bottom-up modeling. In this model, each prefecture-level city in China has been defined as a firm agent, and the Cobb-Douglas production function is adopted. Heterogeneous laborer agents with different technology levels move between firm agents. The laborer migration behavior is affected by Wilson spatial attenuation. The technologies diffuse with the process of laborer migration. Capital also moves between agents as an investment behavior of firms. Different types of roads are endowed with different weights to form a heterogeneous traffic network in this model. A simulation system is built to combine GIS components. Three scenarios are identified to account for the effects of the hierarchical traffic network and preferential tax policies on the evolution of Chinese regional structure. The simulated results indicate that the traditional center-hinterland diffusion mode is no longer appropriate under the impact of heterogeneous traffic network in reality. The technologies firstly diffuse from center cities to sub-hubs along the major traffic lines, following a hub-net diffusion structure, and later from sub-hubs to ordinary nodes located at the branch lines. This phenomenon can also be observed in the capital flow process, in which the capital hubs first interconnect and form a capital flow network along the major traffic roads. After that, the network extends to adjacent ordinary nodes. It is also demonstrated that traffic conditions are important for regional development and that the basic spatial lock-in created by the natural endowments still exists. A preferential tax policy can break such a spatial lock-in to a certain extent and will be conductive to attracting the immigration of laborers and improving the local technology level for less developed regions."

We explore management strategies aimed at maintaining one of two goals - local or global coexistence of species. To achieve their goal, the manager varies the connectivity between patches based on one of three strategies - the monitoring of predator, prey, or the vegetation carrying capacity of the patches. We find that strategies that lead to highest coexistence monitor mid-tier populations globally.

To reflect this typology, a group of 11 farming households were selected. The wives andhusbands of each household were involved in the co-design of the conceptual ABM through a series of fieldworkshops based on role-playing games (15-18 participants).

Cxcr7b-mediated degradation of Cxcl12a by trailing cells generates a local gradient of Cxcl12a that guides PLLp migration. Agent-based computer models were built to explore how a polarized response to Cxcl12a, mediated by Cxcr4b in leading cells and prevented by Cxcr7b in trailing cells, determines unidirectional migration of the PLLp. These chemokine signaling-based models effectively recapitulate many behaviors of the PLLp and provide potential explanations for the characteristic behaviors that emerge when the PLLp is severed by laser to generate leading and trailing fragments. As predicted by our models, the bilateral stretching of the leading fragment is lost when chemokine signaling is blocked in the PLLp. However, movement of the trailing fragment toward the leading cells, which was also thought to be chemokine dependent, persists. This suggested that a chemokine-independent mechanism, not accounted for in our models, is responsible for this behavior. Further investigation of trailing cell behavior shows that their movement toward leading cells depends on FGF signaling and it can be re-oriented by exogenous FGF sources. Together, our observations reveal the simple yet elegant manner in which leading and trailing cells coordinate migration; while leading cells steer PLLp migration by following chemokine cues, cells further back play follow-the-leader as they migrate toward FGFs produced by leading cells. © 2014.

We explore the dynamics between these three factors and discuss how they may affect the capacity of a hominin population to disperse. Generally, we find that high levels of environmental heterogeneity select for increased foresight and that high levels of foresight tend to reduce dispersibility. This suggests that cognitively complex hominins in heterogeneous environments have low dispersibility relative to cognitively less complex organisms in more homogeneous environments. The model predicts that the environments leading up to major episodes of dispersal, such as the initial hominin dispersal into Eurasia, were likely relatively low in spatial heterogeneity and that the dispersing hominins had relatively low foresight. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd."

Drawing upon the literature on the process of developing and parameterizing a social simulation in the absence of spatio-temporal data, the paper outlines the translation of the conceptual framework into a working agent-based model. The possible impact of a change in local rainfall variability and mean upon household income, food production, and therefore the resilience and migration of members, is simulated to permit consideration of the possible impact of the artificial scenarios tested. In addition to the influence of changing rainfall, other non-rainfall scenarios are tested to explore the scale of the changes simulated. It is proposed that while a relatively clear impact of rainfall scenarios upon household resilience is simulated, the impact upon migration of household members is generally less clear. Furthermore, demographic and societal changes to the model are also seen to clearly contribute to the simulation outputs generated. The paper concludes that RABMM-T offers the first step in developing a potentially valuable resource for producing comparable migration forecasts that consider a range of contributory mechanisms.

Further, in the context of climate change, scholarly literature on migration ranges across a host of climatic stressors and geographies, making it difficult to date to solve the debate whether migration is a form of adaptation or an indicator of limits to adaptation. To address both of these debates, original research was undertaken to answer the question 'under what circumstances do households (HHs) use migration as a risk management strategy when facing rainfall variability and food insecurity?'. This research administered a HH survey (n = 1300) and participatory research (n = 2000 respondents) in districts in eight countries (Guatemala, Peru, Ghana, Tanzania, Bangladesh, India, Thailand, and Vietnam). The findings reveal that the answer to how climatic stressors affect migration decisions and the degree to which migration improves the adaptive capacity of those HHs lie in the vulnerability of the HH and its sensitivity to climatic factors. The data reveal for the first time in a comparable global study distinct HH profiles of 'resilience' and 'vulnerability'. At the same time, the article distinguishes between 'content' migration - rather associated with resilient HHs - and 'erosive' migration - rather associated with vulnerable HHs. However, the article also highlights that there are not always clear cuts but very often grey areas and overlaps among the HHs of the study when applying these typologies. Moreover, the article relates these profiles to an agent-based modelling approach applied in the Tanzania case to explore under what scenarios rainfall variability and food security have the potential to become significant drivers of human mobility in particular regions of the world in the next two to three decades. © 2013 © 2013 The Author(s).

Individual learning, unbiased and biased social learning, mixed learning, and learning schedules are considered. A rapidly changing environment or frequent migration in a spatially heterogeneous environment favors individual learning over unbiased social learning. However, results are not so straightforward in the context of learning schedules or when biases in social learning are introduced. The three major methods of modeling temporal environmental change-coevolutionary, two-timescale, and information decay-are compared and shown to sometimes yield contradictory results. The so-called Rogers' paradox is inherent in the two-timescale method as originally applied to the evolution of pure strategies, but is often eliminated when the other methods are used. Moreover, Rogers' paradox is not observed for the mixed learning strategies and learning schedules that we review. We believe that further theoretical work is necessary on learning schedules and biased social learning, based on models that are logically consistent and empirically pertinent. © 2013 Elsevier Inc."

There has been an extensive attention focused on the reproduction of smart agent actions in the framework of agent based modeling. This paper reviews how to combine Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Neural Networks (NN) to simulate evacuation in a goal finding application. The agents have the aptitude to adjust their actions in the situation and devise their reaction by gleaning knowledge from their surroundings. The approach is based on role based collaboration between individual agents as well as between groups of agents. As the agents receive feedback from their environment, they are able to change how they act as they try to achieve their goals. A crowd-modeling and disaster conduct modeling ability is been developed in a goal finding application. This paper studies clever agent-based migrations that can help in the layout of building meeting places and directing designers on achieving a higher probability of efficiency and maximized use of these structures. The findings of this modeling was very encouraging as the agents are able to assume various roles to combine GA and NN on the way to reaching their goals."

The agent/agent interactions are carried out by their social otherwise, the agent/environment interactions are expressed through the consumption of ecological resources in repression and satisfaction by social behaviours of the agent. In this work, we will present the structure and the formulation of our model.

The final steps of this modeling effort are expressed in a code written in a programing language. On account of the complete lack of standardization of the different steps to proceed, we have to deplore poor communication and sharing between experimentalists, theoreticians and programmers. The adoption of diagrammatic visual computer language should however greatly help the immunologists to better communicate, to more easily identify the models similarities and facilitate the reuse and extension of existing software models. Since immunologists often conceptualize the dynamical evolution of immune systems in terms of ""state-transitions"" of biological objects, we promote the use of unified modeling language (UML) state-transition diagram. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we present a UML refactoring of two published models on thymocyte differentiation. Originally built with different modeling strategies, a mathematical ordinary differential equation-based model and a cellular automata model, the two models are now in the same visual formalism and can be compared. The perspective is to encourage immunologists involved into mathematical modeling or software productions, to adopt a visual graphical language, here mainly the unified modeling language (UML) ""state-transition"" diagram to ease the communication, the reuse and the extension of their models. © 2013 Thomas-Vaslin, Six, Ganascia and Bersini."

We then review continuum and agent-based (cellular automata) models with rules of cell movement and logistical proliferation. Both movement and proliferation at the individual cell level are modeled with stochastic components from which stereotyped outcomes emerge at the population level. These models reproduced the wave-like colonization of the intestine by enteric neural crest cells, and several new properties emerged, such as colonization by frontal expansion, which were later confirmed biologically. These models predict a surprising level of clonal heterogeneity both in terms of number and distribution of daughter cells. Biologically, migrating cells form stable chains made up of unstable cells, but this is not seen in the initial model. We outline additional rules for cell differentiation into neurons, axon extension, cell-axon and cell-cell adhesions, chemotaxis and repulsion which can reproduce chain migration. After the migration stage, the cells re-arrange as a network of ganglia. Changes in cell adhesion molecules parallel this, and we describe additional rules based on Steinberg's Differential Adhesion Hypothesis, reflecting changing levels of adhesion in neural crest cells and neurons. This was able to reproduce enteric ganglionation in a model. Mouse mutants with disturbances of enteric nervous system morphogenesis are discussed, and these suggest future refinement of the models. The modeling suggests a relatively simple set of cell behavioral rules could account for complex patterns of morphogenesis. The model has allowed the proposal that Hirschsprung disease is mostly an enteric neural crest cell proliferation defect, not a defect of cell migration. In addition, the model suggests an explanations for zonal and skip segment variants of Hirschsprung disease, and also gives a novel stochastic explanation for the observed discordancy of Hirschsprung disease in identical twins. © 2013 Elsevier Inc."

We investigate the effect of spatial interactions in the opposite case, where populations can persist in well-mixed systems. A stochastic agent-based model of host-pathogen dynamics is considered that describes nearest-neighbor interactions in an undivided habitat. Contrary to previous notions, we find that in this setting, spatial interactions in fact promote extinction. The reason is that, in contrast to the mass-action system, the outcome of the nearest-neighbor model is governed by dynamics in small ""local neighbor-hoods."" This is an abstraction that describes interactions in a minimal grid consisting of an individual plus its nearest neighbors. The small size of this characteristic scale accounts for the higher extinction probabilities. Hence, nearest-neighbor interactions in a continuous habitat lead to outcomes reminiscent of a fragmented habitat, which is underlined further with a metapopulation model that explicitly assumes habitat fragmentation. Beyond host-pathogen dynamics, axiomatic modeling shows that our results hold for generic enemy-victim interactions under specified assumptions. These results are used to interpret a set of published experiments that provide a first step toward model testing and are discussed in the context of the literature. © 2013 by The University of Chicago."

Indeed our study extends from local migration process, in one single port, to cope with the process of migration between multiple ports. In this way, we minimize total running time of this process.

These cells adopt a mesenchymal shape and migrate into the basal lamina. Such transitions have been observed in developmental processes and have been linked to cancer cell metastasis. Most experimental studies on EMT search for molecular markers indicating an epithelial or mesenchymal conformation, focussing on afferent signaling pathways received by cells undergoing this transformation; however, these approaches are unable to track mechanical changes in the cell and the possible role this plays in EMT. In order to address this gap in our understanding, we have used a quantitative approach to study population level effects of single cell changes typically occurring during EMT. We have developed a computational model making use of the advantages of both single cell migratory models and agent-based cell population models to study the effect of cellular molecular processes in EMT. The disruption of a cell sheet representing the epithelium over a dense extracellular matrix (ECM) is simulated using interaction forces between different cells and between cells and discrete fibers representing the ECM. In our study, two different parameters were varied: protrusion force magnitude and E-cadherin (cell-cell junction) concentration. The cell population was tracked for 3 days and the number of cells that leave the layer, the depth of invasion, and the percentage of initial number of cells that remain in the layer (a measure of epithelium disruption) were monitored. Our studies suggest that having a high protrusion force or a reduction in cell-cell attachments is enough to cause EMT. Our results also demonstrate that the morphological progression in membrane disruption has an effect on the number of cells becoming invasive, with epithelial layers broken into clusters hindering the further exodus of cells. The results reveal the quantitative interplay between two key parameters involved in EMT and suggest potential avenues for further exploration of a systems level understanding of EMT. © 2013 S.

Urban areas face both a changing urban population size and increasing sustainability issues in terms of providing good socioeconomic and environmental living conditions. Urban planning has to deal with both challenges. Households play a major role by being affected by urban planning decisions on the one hand and by being responsible - among many other factors - for the environmental performance of a city (e.g. energy use). We here present an agent-based decision model referring to the city of Vienna, the capital of Austria, with a population of about 1.7 million (2.3 million within the metropolitan area, the latter being more than 25% of Austria's total population). Since the early 1990s, after decades of negative population growth, Vienna has been experiencing a steady increase in population, mainly driven by immigration. The aim of the agent-based decision model is to simulate new residential patterns of different household types based on demographic development and migration scenarios. Model results were used to assess spatial patterns of energy use caused by different household types in the four scenarios (1) conventional urban planning, (2) sustainable urban planning, (3) expensive centre and (4) no green area preference. Outcomes show that changes in preferences of households relating to the presence of nearby green areas have the most important impact on the distribution of households across the small-scaled city area. Additionally, the results demonstrate the importance of the distribution of different household types regarding spatial patterns of energy use. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd."

Implementing an adequate level of agent heterogeneity and mapping it into a spatial environment are critical factors of such applied modelling. However, policy applications demand the characterisation and parameterisation of behavioural response functions of heterogeneous agents and the spatial distribution of heterogeneous agents, which are neither highly transparent nor greatly tested steps in implementing agent-based models. This paper describes an agent-based model of fuel price changes for a case study in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, and specifically: (a) the characterisation and parameterisation approach, (b) resulting agent types for approximating behavioural heterogeneity, and (c) emerging spatial poverty and deforestation patterns. The model highlights the spatial dynamics of poverty dynamics, indicating that the direct impact of deforestation on poverty among forest-dwelling communities is to trigger their migration into peri-urban areas. Overall, the model suggests that poverty increases in response to fuel price reductions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd."

However, what is unclear is how cell contact dynamics and the distinct microenvironments through which cells travel influence the selection of one migratory mode or the other. The embryonic and highly invasive neural crest (NC) are an excellent model system to study this question since NC cells have been observed in vivo to display both of these types of cell motility. Here, we present data from tissue transplantation experiments in chick and in silico modeling that test our hypothesis that cell contact dynamics with each other and the microenvironment promote and sustain either multicellular stream or chain migration. We show that when premigratory cranial NC cells (at the pre-otic level) are transplanted into a more caudal region in the head (at the post-otic level), cells alter their characteristic stream behavior and migrate in chains. Similarly, post-otic NC cells migrate in streams after transplantation into the pre-otic hindbrain, suggesting that local microenvironmental signals dictate the mode of NC cell migration. Simulations of an agent-based model (ABM) that integrates the NC cell behavioral data predict that chain migration critically depends on the interplay of biased cell-cell contact and local microenvironment signals. Together, this integrated modeling and experimental approach suggests new experiments and offers a powerful tool to examine mechanisms that underlie complex cell migration patterns. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd."

The selection forces are dynamic and depend on many factors. The cells favored by selection are said to be more ""fit"" than others. They tend to leave more viable offspring and spread through the population. What cellular characteristics make certain cells more fit than others? What combinations of the mutant characteristics and "" background"" characteristics make the mutant cells win the evolutionary competition? In this review we concentrate on two phenotypic characteristics of cells: their reproductive potential and their motility. We show that migration has a direct positive impact on the ability of a single mutant cell to invade a pre-existing colony. Thus, a decrease in the reproductive potential can be compensated by an increase in cell migration. We further demonstrate that the neutral ridges (the set of all types with the invasion probability equal to that of the host cells) remain invariant under the increase of system size (for large system sizes), thus making the invasion probability a universal characteristic of the cells' selection status. We list very general conditions under which the optimal phenotype is just one single strategy (thus leading to a nearly-homogeneous type invading the colony), or a large set of strategies that differ by their reproductive potentials and migration characteristics, but have a nearly-equal fitness. In the latter case the evolutionary competition will result in a highly heterogeneous population."

Bucci cubo 41c, 87036 Rende (CS), Italy","The capture of the execution state of agents in agent-based and multi-agent systems is a system feature needed to enable agent checkpointing, persistency and strong mobility that are basic mechanisms supporting more complex, distributed policies and algorithms for fault tolerance, load balancing, and transparent migration. Unfortunately, the majority of the currently available platforms for agents, particularly those based on the standard Java Virtual Machine, do not provide this important feature at the system-level. Several system-level and application-level approaches have been to date proposed for agent state execution capture. Although system-level approaches are effective, they modify the underlying virtual machine so endangering compatibility. Conversely, application-level approaches do not modify any system layer but they provide sophisticated agent programming models and/or agent converters that only allow a coarse-grain capture of agent state execution. In this paper, we propose an application-level technique that allows for a programmable-grain capture of the execution state of agents ranging from a per-instruction to a statement-driven state capture. The technique is based on the Distilled StateCharts Star (DSC*) formalism that offers an agent-oriented type of recursive hierarchical state machines. According to the proposed technique a single-threaded agent program can be translated into a DSC* machine, containing agent data, code and execution state, by preserving the original agent program semantics. The proposed technique can notably be applied to any agent program written through an imperative-style, procedural or object-oriented programming language. Currently, it is implemented in Java and fully integrated into the JADE framework, being JADE one of the most diffused agent platforms. In particular, agents, which are specified through a generic Java-like agent language, can be automatically translated into JADE agents according to the JADE DSCStarBehaviour framework by means of a translator tool. A simple yet effective running example is used to exemplify the proposed technique from modeling to implementation. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Experimental studies are often performed to investigate the role of scaffold architecture on vascularized tissue formation. However, experiments are expensive and time-consuming and synthesis protocols often do not allow for independent investigation of specific scaffold properties. Computational models allow for rapid screening of potential material designs with control over scaffold properties that is difficult in laboratory settings. We have developed and tested a three-dimensional agent-based framework for investigating the effect of scaffold pore architecture on angiogenesis. Software agents represent endothelial cells, interacting together and with their micro-environment, leading to the invasion of blood vessels into the scaffold. A rule base, driven by experimental findings, governs the behavior of individual agents. 3D scaffold models with well-defined homogeneous and heterogeneous pore architectures were simulated to investigate the impact of various design parameters. Simulation results indicate that pores of larger size with higher interconnectivity and porosity support rapid and extensive angiogenesis.

Investigators have applied various computational approaches to understand the impact the internal dynamics of such devices has on overall cell growth, but such models cannot provide a comprehensive perspective regarding the system dynamics, due to limitations inherent to the underlying approaches. In this study, a novel multi-paradigm modeling platform capable of simulating the dynamic bidirectional relationship between cells and their microenvironment is presented. Designing the modeling platform entailed combining and coupling fully an agent-based modeling platform with a transport phenomena computational modeling framework. To demonstrate capability, the platform was used to study the impact of bioreactor parameters on the overall cell population behavior and vice versa. In order to achieve this, virtual bioreactors were constructed and seeded. The virtual cells, guided by a set of rules involving the simulated mass transport inside the bioreactor, as well as cell-related probabilistic parameters, were capable of displaying an array of behaviors such as proliferation, migration, chemotaxis and apoptosis. In this way the platform was shown to capture not only the impact of bioreactor transport processes on cellular behavior but also the influence that cellular activity wields on that very same local mass transport, thereby influencing overall cell growth. The platform was validated by simulating cellular chemotaxis in a virtual direct visualization chamber and comparing the simulation with its experimental analogue. The results presented in this paper are in agreement with published models of similar flavor. The modeling platform can be used as a concept selection tool to optimize bioreactor design specifications. © 2013 Kaul et al."

Two explanations have been proposed for this result: The first is that the troop surge worked by increasing counterinsurgent capacity, whereas the second argument is that ethnic unmixing and the establishment of relatively homogenous enclaves were responsible for declining violence in Baghdad through reducing contact. We address this question using an agent-based model that is built on GIS-coded data on violence and ethnic composition in Baghdad. While we cannot fully resolve the debate about the effectiveness of the surge, our model shows that patterns of violence and segregation in Baghdad are consistent with a simple mechanism of ethnically motivated attacks and subsequent migration. Our modeling exercise also informs current debates about the effectiveness of counterinsurgency operations. We implement a simple policing mechanism in our model and show that even small levels of policing can dramatically mitigate subsequent levels of violence. However, our results also show that the timing of these efforts is crucial; early responses to ethnic violence are highly effective, but quickly lose impact as their implementation is delayed. © 2013 International Studies Association."

Recent investigations have established that with just 1 mutation current avian influenza viral strains gain the ability to be readily transmitted between humans. These investigations further motivate the need for detailed analysis, in addition to satellite surveillance, of migratory patterns and its influence on the ecology of the disease to aid design and assessment of prophylaxis and containment strategies for emergent epidemics. Accordingly, this paper proposes a novel methodology for generating a global agent-based stochastic epidemiological model involving detailed migratory patterns of waterfowl. The methodology transforms Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data containing global distribution of various species of waterfowl to generate metapopulation for agents that model collocated flocks of birds. Generic migratory flyways are suitably adapted to model migratory ffyways for each waterfowl metapopulation. Migratory characteristics of various species are used to determine temporal attributes for the flyways. The resulting data is generated in XML format compatible with our simulation-based epidemiological analysis environment called SEARUMS. Case studies conducted using SEARUMS and the generated models for high-risk waterfowl species indicate good correlation between simulated and observed viral dispersion patterns, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methodology."

At the beginning of the simulation, long fibers were randomly distributed and cross linked. Throughout the simulation, imposed rules allowed cells to exert traction forces by extending pseudopodia, binding to fibers and pulling them towards the cell. Simulated cells remodeled the fibrous matrix to change both the density and alignment of fibers and migrated within the matrix in ways that are consistent with previous experimental work. For example, cells compacted the matrix in their pericellular regions much more than the average compaction experienced for the entire matrix (696% versus 21%). Between pairs of cells, the matrix density increased (by 92%) and the fibers became more aligned (anisotropy index increased from 0.45 to 0.68) in the direction parallel to a line connecting the two cells, consistent with the “lines of tension” observed in experiments by others. Cells migrated towards one another at an average rate of ˜0.5 cell diameters per 10, 000 arbitrary units (AU); faster migration occurred in simulations where the fiber density in the intercellular area was greater. To explore the potential contribution of matrix stiffness gradients in the observed migration (i.e., durotaxis), the model was altered to contain a regular lattice of fibers possessing a stiffness gradient and just a single cell. In these simulations cells migrated preferentially in the direction of increasing stiffness at a rate of ˜2 cell diameter per 10, 000 AU.

Human activities are threatening this biodiversity, and many endemic populations now face a medium-term risk of extinction. An individual-based model called DemGenTrout was developed to improve the management of these populations. The model was parameterized, optimized and validated with demographic, genetic, and environmental data collected over 7 years on the Lesse River drainage (Belgium). The sensitivity of the model to its parameters was analysed. The model was then used to assess how the demogenetics of a wild trout population might be affected by anthropogenic disturbances. From the sensitivity analysis, we found that modifications in survival and spawning parameters could lead to important changes in the demogenetics of the studied brown trout population. Two parameters were identified as the most influential in the DemGenTrout model, the survival rate of fry in the brook, and the mean of the spawner condition factor distribution. Two scenarios were simulated over 35 years and compared: (i) a barrier to upstream spawning migration, (ii) stocking with hatchery-reared trout during a 10-year period. Both of them appeared to have a strong short-term impact on the demogenetic structure of the wild trout population. The migration barrier mostly impacted abundance, while genetic issues arose when a significant number of stocked fish survived in the wild. Stocking also appeared to act on a longer time frame if hatchery and wild trout had similar survival and spawning probabilities. © 2012 Elsevier B.V."

In agent-based micro-simulations, gravity models can be directly used to represent movement of individuals and hence disease. In this paper, we consider a range of gravity models as fits to movement data from the UK and the US. We examine the ability of synthetic networks generated from fitted models to match those from the data in terms of epidemic behaviour; in particular, times to first infection. For both datasets, best fits are obtained with a two-piece 'matched' power law distance distribution. Epidemics on synthetic UK networks match well those on data networks across all but the smallest nodes for a range of aggregation levels. We derive an expression for time to infection between nodes in terms of epidemiological and network parameters which illuminates the influence of network clustering in spread across networks and suggests an approximate relationship between the log-likelihood deviance of model fit and the match times to infection between synthetic and data networks. On synthetic US networks, the match in epidemic behaviour is initially poor and sensitive to the initially infected node. Analysis of times to infection indicates a failure of models to capture infrequent long-range contact between large nodes. An assortative model based on node population size captures this heterogeneity, considerably improving the epidemiological match between synthetic and data networks. © 2012 Truscott, Ferguson."

Berne Cardiovascular Research Center, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22908, United States","Effective management of healing and remodelling after myocardial infarction is an important problem in modern cardiology practice. We have recently shown that the level of infarct anisotropy is a critical determinant of heart function following a large anterior infarction, which suggests that therapeutic gains may be realized by controlling infarct anisotropy. However, factors regulating infarct anisotropy are not well understood. Mechanical, structural and chemical guidance cues have all been shown to regulate alignment of fibroblasts and collagen in vitro, and prior studies have proposed that each of these cues could regulate anisotropy of infarct scar tissue, but understanding of fibroblast behaviour in the complex environment of a healing infarct is lacking. We developed an agent-based model of infarct healing that accounted for the combined influence of these cues on fibroblast alignment, collagen deposition and collagen remodelling. We pooled published experimental data from several sources in order to determine parameter values, then used the model to test the importance of each cue for predicting collagen alignment measurements from a set of recent cryoinfarction experiments. We found that although chemokine gradients and pre-existing matrix structures had important effects on collagen organization, a response of fibroblasts to mechanical cues was critical for correctly predicting collagen alignment in infarct scar. Many proposed therapies for myocardial infarction, such as injection of cells or polymers, alter the mechanics of the infarct region. Our modelling results suggest that such therapies could change the anisotropy of the healing infarct, which could have important functional consequences. This model is therefore a potentially important tool for predicting how such interventions change healing outcomes. © 2012 The Physiological Society."

Understanding how interactions between these factors influence the risk of transmission could improve the effectiveness of the allocation of vector control resources. To evaluate the combined impacts of variation in A. aegypti production and human density we integrated field data with simulation modeling. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using data from seven censuses of A. aegypti pupae (2007-2009) and from demographic surveys, we developed an agent-based transmission model of the dengue transmission cycle across houses in 16 dengue-endemic urban 'patches' (1-3 city blocks each) of Armenia, Colombia. Our field data showed that 92% of pupae concentrated in only 5% of houses, defined as super-producers. Average secondary infections (R0) depended on infrequent, but highly explosive transmission events. These super-spreading events occurred almost exclusively when the introduced infectious person infected mosquitoes that were produced in super-productive containers. Increased human density favored R0, and when the likelihood of human introduction of virus was incorporated into risk, a strong interaction arose between vector production and human density. Simulated intervention of super-productive containers was substantially more effective in reducing dengue risk at higher human densities. Significance/Conclusions: These results show significant interactions between human population density and the natural regulatory pattern of A. aegypti in the dynamics of dengue transmission. The large epidemiological significance of super-productive containers suggests that they have the potential to influence dengue viral adaptation to mosquitoes. Human population density plays a major role in dengue transmission, due to its potential impact on human-A. aegypti contact, both within a person's home and when visiting others. The large variation in population density within typical dengue endemic cities suggests that it should be a major consideration in dengue control policy. © 2012 Padmanabha et al."

Here, we developed a quantitative agent-based modelling framework to test mechanistic hypotheses of chain migration persistence. We defined chain migration and its persistence based on evidence from the highly migratory neural crest model system, where cells within a chain extend and retract filopodia in short-lived cell contacts and move together as a collective. In our agent-based simulations, we began with a set of agents arranged as a chain and systematically probed the influence of model parameters to identify factors critical to the maintenance of the chain migration pattern. We discovered that chain migration persistence requires a high degree of directional bias in both lead and follower cells towards the target. Chain migration persistence was also promoted when lead cells maintained cell contact with followers, but not vice-versa. Finally, providing a path of least resistance in the ECM was not sufficient alone to drive chain persistence. Our results indicate that chain migration persistence depends on the interplay of directional cell movement and biased cell-cell contact. © 2012 The Royal Society."

Numerous complex processes potentially influence the transport of spermatozoa within the tract, resulting in a regulated supply of spermatozoa to the oocytes at the site of fertilization. Despite significant differences between species, breeds, and individuals, these processes converge to ensure that a sufficient number of high quality spermatozoa reach the oocytes, resulting in successful fertilization without a significant risk of polyspermy. Different factors, such as the physical complexity of the oviductal environment, changing swimming patterns, capacitation, chemotactic and thermotactic attraction, attachment and detachment from the oviductal epithelium, interactions with local oviductal secretions, individual variations in spermatozoa and subpopulations, peristaltic contractions, and the movement of fluid have all been theorized to influence the transport of spermatozoa to the site of fertilization.

Besides using a multinomial logit choice model that allows for agent idiosyncrasy, explicit agent heterogeneity is introduced in the form of socio-demographic characteristics preferred by modern-sector employers. We find that different combinations of the strength of social influence and the socio-economic composition of the workforce lead to very different urbanization and urban informal sector shares.

However, the dynamic shifts underway affecting consumer behaviors will likely limit the value of the current approaches to the near term insights. We propose that a longer view requires a method of analysis and assessment more appropriate to the plausible variations in economic, energy, population, and other dynamics that affect future transportation consumption. We present the case for and the summary of our implementation of such a method in this paper. The inputs to our analysis are developed in the context of a set of global external drivers, four independent drivers in our case, each of which can exhibit more (or higher) or less (or lower) influences affecting parameters that in turn affect transportation demand (such as GDP, energy prices, population dynamics, etc.). Further, because we cannot predict particular futures, we also need a means of establishing groups (or plausible ""worlds"") of parameter settings that respond to combinations of global drivers. In the context of the four drivers, the study team established combinations of dependent parameters, five sets of parameters (or five plausible ""worlds"") in our case, in the context of the combinations of levels of influence of the drivers. The outputs of the analysis will include demand for all modes of transportation (air, ground, and virtual), quantity of demand that can be satisfied through new or existing aircraft and business models, environmental impact considerations, the longer-term coevolutionary effects of migration (for example) on locations of demand and supply. We observe that our approach overcomes some limitations of current approaches for understanding transportation demand and satisfaction in the farther term. The implementation of our method employs agent-based (ABM) demand and supply modeling, coupled with airspace modeling tools used for airspace capacity analyses under various NextGen airspace operating concepts. The process generates demand for mobility by all modes, using transportation gravity laws, tailored for leisure and business travel separately. The modes include scheduled air carriers, highway driving, on-demand electric aircraft, virtual (telepresence), rail, and bus. Then we test that demand against constraints associated with system capacities, fleet vehicle size considerations, and environment (noise and emissions), for each of the five ""worlds."" With the process, we can evaluate strategic thinking for options beyond the current NextGen implementation plans, as well as for technology strategies beyond those currently in place in the Federal research sector. We propose that the limitations of current approaches highlight the need for an alternative such as we offer, as a means of stress testing the future performance of the NAS under a broader range of plausible futures."

Global climate change adds to the gravity of these effects. The survival of wildlife species is subjected to enormous pressure due to natural environmental changes and human activities. Agent-based models (ABMs) are computer simulation models analyzing and simulating human or animal behavior through the integration of learning, adaptation, evolution and logical analysis. ABMs study the overall system characteristics by analyzing internal elements of the system (such as the interaction among individual agents, and agents with the environment) with a bottom-up approach. The agents in ABMs can complete given objectives, perceive and respond to changes of the external environment through the default logic control, and respond to stimuli from other agents and the external environment through learning and adaptation functions. This paper designed an agent-based evaluation model of an ecological pattern, which was used to analyze the impact of different woodland patterns on species survival and dispersal. The model focused on the logic control of survival and dispersal of agents, and used the dispersal strategy integrating CRW and LW models, which combines the advantages of these two models. The survival of the agent is control by the age-specified U-shaped survival curve and determination function considering their own energy and environmental risks. The model was developed on the GIS platform, realizing the seamless integration of the agent model and GIS, which could then be applied to real geographical environment simulation. Qingdao is a city located in the eastern coastal region of China where the economy is relatively well-developed. The region is also where marine and terrestrial ecosystems meet. Woodland is mainly distributed in the Laoshan Mountains in the east, the Daze Mountains in the north, and the Dazhu, Xiaozhu and Tiejue Mountains in the south. In the study area, the ecological environment is deteriorating, and various wildlife species are being impacted, with some species being endangered or facing extinction. This paper selected the woodlands in the Qingdao district as the study object, analyzing the effect of different spatial patterns on the survival and spread of woodland species. Simulation results showed that, compared with the original state, species populations and migration have improved significantly under different levels of ecological network framework, and the higher the level of ecological network framework, the more obvious the improvement. The distance between patches had a large influence on the dispersal of simulated species because they were not able to arrive at patches that were far away from the original patch. Therefore, this paper makes the suggestion that an approach integrating wetland and woodland systems could strengthen woodland system functional contact in the study area. It is suggested that the region around Jiaozhou Bay and the mainstream of Dagu River be used to increase the spatial distribution of woodland. Based on the simulation results, suggestions for the woodland ecological pattern construction are given below: (1) ensure that the large woodland can not be destroyed; (2) the wetland system district in the middle of Qingdao is an ideal place for a new woodland construction; (3) the ecological network framework can be used as a spatial reference for an ecological barrier to prevent the spread of urban land into woodland."

Epithelial restitution occurs quickly to reestablish the barrier and comprises a major part of the immediate host response to injured tissue. Pathways involving transforming growth factor beta and activation of epidermal growth factor receptor are both of critical importance, although cross-pathway interactions have been poorly characterized. Agent-based modeling has been showed to be useful in integrating disparate bodies of knowledge and showing the dynamic consequences of pathway structures and cellular population behavior and is used herein to create an in silico analog of an in vitro scratch assay. The In Vitro Scratch Agent-Based Model consists of agents representing individual epithelial cells in a simulated extracellular matrix. Agents sense signals from the damaged environment and produce effector molecules, leading to their healing behavior. The In Vitro Scratch Agent-Based Model qualitatively matched wound healing dynamics when compared against data from traditional experiments. Putative cross-talk mechanisms were then instantiated into the In Vitro Scratch Agent-Based Model and their relative plausibility examined, suggesting interaction at the receptor tyrosine kinase level. This highlights the utility of dynamic knowledge representation in the integration of pathways previously studied in separate contexts. © 2012 by the Wound Healing Society."

At the intracellular level, the MABM approach employs a system of ordinary differential equations to describe quantitatively specific intracellular molecular pathways that determine phenotypic switches among cells (e.g. from migration to proliferation and vice versa). At the intercellular level, MABM describes cell-cell interactions by a discrete module. At the tissue level, partial differential equations are employed to model the diffusion of chemoattractants, which are the input factors of the intracellular molecular pathway. Moreover, multiscale analysis makes it possible to explore the molecules that play important roles in determining the cellular phenotypic switches that in turn drive the whole GBM expansion. However, owing to limited computational resources, MABM is currently a theoretical biological model that uses relatively coarse grids to simulate a few cancer cells in a small slice of brain cancer tissue. In order to improve this theoretical model to simulate and predict actual GBM cancer progression in real time, a graphics processing unit (GPU)-based parallel computing algorithm was developed and combined with the multi-resolution design to speed up the MABM. The simulated results demonstrated that the GPU-based, multi-resolution and multiscale approach can accelerate the previous MABM around 30-fold with relatively fine grids in a large extracellular matrix. Therefore, the new model has great potential for simulating and predicting real-time GBM progression, if real experimental data are incorporated. © 2011 Zhang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."
278,1,0,Landis J.D.,Urban Growth Models: State Of The Art And Prospects,2011,Global Urbanization,"Department of City and Regional Planning, School of Design, University of Pennsylvania, United States","Once known as urban activity models, urban growth models (UGMs) emerged in the mid-1960s out of advances in regional science, huge improvements in computing speed and storage capacity (or so they seemed at the time), a newfound surplus of detailed activity data, and federal mandates coupled with funding for metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) to back up transportation funding requests with careful projections and hard-headed analysis. Overhyped and underdeveloped, early urban models soon proved unreliable. Their epitaph, ""Requiem for Large-Scale Models,"" published in the Journal of the American Institute of Planners (Lee 1973), is still one of the most widely read and cited journal articles in planning. By the early 1990s, UGMs had staged a small-scale comeback, buoyed by new modeling techniques - especially discrete choice models - further improvements in computing speed and storage capacity, the migration of GIS from mainframe to desktop, advances in data distribution channels (first CDs, later the Internet), and by the desire of local governments and MPOs to go beyond linear trend lines to investigate alternative planning scenarios. By 2000, a survey by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had uncovered more than twenty urban forecasting and simulation models, most of which had not existed just ten years earlier (U.S. EPA 2000). Recent and dramatic increases in the availability of high-resolution satellite imagery have given even greater impetus to urban modeling. Recent developments in urban modeling have been chronicled by Batty (1994, 2005) and Wegener (1994, 1998b). For the most part, UGMs have been developed and applied in the Global North, where their data needs can be more easily met. Recent improvements in remote sensing offer potential for their use in the Global South. The allure of UGMs remains as siren-like today as in the 1960s. Foremost, they offer the promise of reducing huge volumes of local data into a few robust and understandable generalizations about processes of urban change. Second, they promise to facilitate thinking about the future of cities in ways that are new, nontraditional, and spatial. Third, with the addition of discrete choice modeling, they offer the ability to link the decisions and behaviors of individual agents to metropolitan outcomes; and this, more than any other capability, is the key to planning for sustainability. Fourth and most important, they provide a key analytical bridge between envisioning alternative urban development patterns and evaluating their impacts. Promise and performance, however, don't always go hand in hand. Fifteen years after their resurrection, questions about UGMs still remain. Are they facilitating better metropolitan investment and policy decisions? Are they leading to a richer, more nuanced, and more comprehensive understanding of the effects of those investment and policy decisions? Are they helping open up local and metropolitan discussions about development to new ideas, approaches, and participants? Are they making the practice of local and metropolitan planning noticeably better? The answer to these questions for the most part is ""no"": UGMs are still too complicated, still too untested, and still too slow to adapt to local circumstances to be used regularly and reliably. Nonetheless, progress continues, and the state of the art of urban modeling advances daily. This chapter takes a hopeful but critical look at UGMs through the lens of four archetypes: (1) the IRPUD (Institute for Regional Planning and Urban Development) model developed at the University of Dortmund, the best heir to the spatial interaction models of the 1960s; (2) the SLEUTH (Slope, Land Use, Exclusion, Urban extent, Transportation, Hillshade) model, an example of the use of cellular automata (CA) procedures to model urban change; (3) the California Urban Futures (CUF) family of urban growth models, the first to employ GIS; and (4) UrbanSim, the leading example of agent-based urban modeling.1 All four share two essential characteristics: they are calibrated, which means their coefficients are estimated from historical experience and are therefore not ad hoc; and they are spatially explicit, capable of looking at urban change at the level of an individual parcel (or comparably sized grid cell). This chapter is organized in four sections. The first, ""Why Urban Growth Models?"" explains UGM functions. The second, ""Four Archetypal Urban Growth Models,"" introduces the four selected UGMs. The third, ""Model Comparisons,"" looks at their respective structures, calibration procedures, ease of data assembly, and usefulness for simulation. The fourth, ""A UGM Research and Development Agenda,"" offers ideas for future modeling developments and application efforts and reflects on the future uses of UGMs worldwide.

These studies generally make simplistic assumptions about the response of an individual to variations in climate. However, empirical evidence of environmentally induced migration does not support such a structural approach and recognises that migration decisions are usually both multi-causal and shaped through individual agency. As such, agent-based modelling offers a robust method to simulate the autonomous decision making process relating to environmental migration. The Theory of Planned Behaviour provides a basis that can be used to effectively break down the reasoning process relating to the development of a behavioural intention. By developing an agent-based model of environmental migration for Burkina Faso from the basis of a combination of such theoretical developments and data analysis we further investigate the role of the environment in the decision to migrate using scenarios of future demographic, economic, social, political, and climate change in a dryland context. We find that in terms of climate change, it can be seen that that change to a drier environment produces the largest total and international migration fluxes when combined with changes to inclusive and connected social and political governance. While the lowest international migration flows are produced under a wetter climate with exclusive and diverse governance scenarios. In summary this paper illustrates how agent-based models incorporating the Theory of Planned Behaviour can be used to project evidence based future changes in migration in response to future demographic, economic social and climate change. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd."

This central-peripheral group structure can arise by self-organization as a result of subordinates fleeing from dominants after losing a fight. However, in real primates, subordinates often avoid interactions with potentially aggressive group members, thereby preventing aggression and subsequent fleeing. Using agent-based modeling, we investigated which spatial and encounter structures emerge when subordinates also avoid known potential aggressors at a distance as compared with the model which only included fleeing after losing a fight (fleeing model). A central-peripheral group structure emerged in most conditions. When avoidance was employed at small or intermediate distances, centrality of dominants emerged similar to the fleeing model, but in a more pronounced way. This result was also found when fleeing after a fight was made independent of dominance rank, i.e. occurred randomly. Employing avoidance at larger distances yielded more spread out groups. This provides a possible explanation of larger group spread in more aggressive species. With avoidance at very large distances, spatially and socially distinct subgroups emerged. We also investigated how encounters were distributed amongst group members. In the fleeing model all individuals encountered all group members equally often, whereas in the avoidance model encounters occurred mostly among similar-ranking individuals. Finally, we also identified a very general and simple mechanism causing a central-peripheral group structure: when individuals merely differed in velocity, faster individuals automatically ended up at the periphery. In summary, a central-peripheral group pattern can easily emerge from individual variation in different movement properties in general, such as fleeing, avoidance or velocity. Moreover, avoidance behavior also affects the encounter structure and can lead to subgroup formation. © 2011 Evers et al."

In this paper we propose a new multi-evolutionary agent model dedicated to social simulations, mainly for those problems where higher order dynamic behaviors (e.g. secondary emergent phenomena) are important to the investigated phenomenon. Its usefulness lies on its multilevel evolutionary adaptability which enables it to capture multiple parallel phenomena. To verify our hypothesis we applied the model to Brazilian internal human migration phenomenon and to the influence of social networks on migration flows. This is followed by a comparative analysis against simulations carried out based on a non-evolutionary cognitive agent model. Results show that the proposed model was able to rise secondary migration-related phenomena such as countermigration flows. Experiments with the cognitive agent also produced the emergence of migration flows but no secondary phenomenon was observed which was the case with our approach.

The models aims at reproducing a distribution of settlements with statistical and spatial characteristics similar to a historically produced pattern. The model operates on a representation of a real territory, taking into account hydrography and relief. The two main goals are to obtain a rank size distribution of the size of settlements which corresponds to a power law (also known as the Zipf Law of settlements) and to place the settlements in the territory in patterns that are close to the real ones, in zones where settlements were the result of a long historical process. The goal of the project was to demonstrate that a set of relatively simple rules could produce a complex pattern, similar to the result of a long and complex historical process. Therefore, it is an assumed reductionist approach. Our conclusions show that a simple territorial logic, taking into account the quality of land, accessibility, population growth and migration preferences could reproduce Zipf distributions and interesting patterns of agent flow among the settlements created. However, achieving spatial patterns closer to the historical record needs an extra dimension involving field of sight.

The hallmark of infection is the emergence of organized structures of immune cells forming primarily in the lung in response to infection. Granulomas physically contain and immunologically restrain bacteria that cannot be cleared. We have developed several models that spatially characterize the dynamics of the host-mycobacterial interaction, and identified mechanisms that control granuloma formation and development. In particular, we published several agent-based models (ABMs) of granuloma formation in TB that include many subtypes of T cell populations, macrophages as well as key cytokine and chemokine effector molecules. These ABM studies emphasize the important role of T-cell related mechanisms in infection progression, such as magnitude and timing of T cell recruitment, and macrophage activation. In these models, the priming and recruitment of T cells from the lung draining lymph node (LN) was captured phenomenologically. In addition to these ABM studies, we have also developed several multi-organ models using ODEs to examine trafficking of cells between, for example, the lung and LN. While we can predict temporal dynamic behaviors, those models are not coupled to the spatial aspects of granuloma. To this end, we have developed a multi-organ model that is hybrid: an ABM for the lung compartment and a non-linear system of ODE representing the lymph node compartment. This hybrid multi-organ approach to study TB granuloma formation in the lung and immune priming in the LN allows us to dissect protective mechanisms that cannot be achieved using the single compartment or multi-compartment ODE system. The main finding of this work is that trafficking of important cells known as antigen presenting cells from the lung to the lymph node is a key control mechanism for protective immunity: the entire spectrum of infection outcomes can be regulated by key immune cell migration rates. Our hybrid multi-organ implementation suggests that effector CD4+ T cells can rescue the system from a persistent infection and lead to clearance once a granuloma is fully formed. This could be effective as an immunotherapy strategy for latently infected individuals. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd."

A variety of computational models have been developed, each focusing on different aspects of the angiogenesis process and occurring at different biological scales, ranging from the molecular to the tissue levels. Integration of models at different scales is a challenging and currently unsolved problem. Results: We present an object-oriented module-based computational integration strategy to build a multiscale model of angiogenesis that links currently available models. As an example case, we use this approach to integrate modules representing microvascular blood flow, oxygen transport, vascular endothelial growth factor transport and endothelial cell behavior (sensing, migration and proliferation). Modeling methodologies in these modules include algebraic equations, partial differential equations and agent-based models with complex logical rules. We apply this integrated model to simulate exercise-induced angiogenesis in skeletal muscle. The simulation results compare capillary growth patterns between different exercise conditions for a single bout of exercise. Results demonstrate how the computational infrastructure can effectively integrate multiple modules by coordinating their connectivity and data exchange. Model parameterization offers simulation flexibility and a platform for performing sensitivity analysis. Conclusions: This systems biology strategy can be applied to larger scale integration of computational models of angiogenesis in skeletal muscle, or other complex processes in other tissues under physiological and pathological conditions. © 2011 Liu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

In the Prisoner's Dilemma, neither imitation of more successful strategies nor the migration to more favorable locations can promote cooperation. However, when both microscopic mechanisms are combined, they cause the segregation of cooperators and defectors, and the self-organization of cooperative clusters on the macro-level.

The ABM simulates decision-making processes at the household level that is examined through a longitudinal, socio-economic and demographic survey that was conducted in 1990 and 1999. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are used to establish spatial relationships between farms and their environment, while classified Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery is used to set initial land-use/land-cover conditions for the spatial simulation, assess from-to land-use/land-cover change patterns, and describe trajectories of land use change at the farm and landscape levels. Results from prior studies in the NEA provide insights into the key social and ecological variables, describe human behavioral functions, and examine population-environment interactions that are linked to deforestation and agricultural extensification, population migration, and demographic change. Within the architecture of the model, agents are classified as active or passive. The model comprises four modules, i.e., initialization, demography, agriculture, and migration that operate individually, but are linked through key household processes. The main outputs of the model include a spatially-explicit representation of the land use/land cover on survey and non-survey farms and at the landscape level for each annual time-step, as well as simulated socio-economic and demographic characteristics of households and communities. The work describes the design and implementation of the model and how population-environment interactions can be addressed in a frontier setting. The paper contributes to land change science by examining important pattern-process relations, advocating a spatial modeling approach that is capable of synthesizing fundamental relationships at the farm level, and links people and environment in complex ways. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd."

Housing location decision-making is a complex process involving many features of the housing market that interact with the perceptions of home searchers. Although modellers have paid much attention to the prices and utilities of the environmental, ecological, and public services associated with housing, the housing search process is neglected in many agent-based land use models involving urban housing market. The challenge of incorporating housing search partially lies in the prohibitive cost of identifying, recording, and quantifying housing search activities at a large scale. This paper presents an agent-based model of intraurban migration featuring straightforward yet empirically accurate rules for housing search. Drawing on intervening opportunity and intraurban migration theories, this model is specified and calibrated using real-world housing vacancies and relocation origin-destination pairs extracted from parcel records available in the Twin Cities for 2005 to 2007. Multiple validation methods, including inner migration rates, Syrjala tests, and minimum spanning tree comparisons, show that the search rules based on housing vacancy distribution and negative exponential distance-decay probability can satisfactorily simulate the pattern of the housing search and locational choices made by homeowners in the Twin Cities of Minnesota."

Amenity migration (i.e. movement of people from metropolitan to rural settings) is a major driving force of this transition in many areas. However, the effects of amenity migration on the receiving landscapes are not yet fully understood. Agent-based land use modelling helps unravel the complex spatio-temporal relationships that affect landscape response to change from amenity migration. A land subdivision module is essential for a complete agent-based land use model developed for these landscapes because the land sold to in-migrants are lots that are subdivided from much larger tracts. In this paper we describe a land subdivision automation procedure and its implementation for a rectangular land system. It takes into account the dimensions of the candidate parcel, minimum lot size, and initial street arrangement for both target and neighbouring parcels. Subdivision layouts can be generated either to achieve the maximum number of lots or an optimal balance between number of lots and new streets. This module provides subdivision layouts for all candidate parcels in the land use model. And it potentially serves as an integral component in many other models, as well as a stand alone tool for generating subdivision layouts, complex polygon splitting and studies that attempt to establish relationships between land subdivision and habitat fragmentation."

The proper representation of individual-individual and individual-environment interaction in agent-based simulations of such systems is, therefore, of paramount importance to model design. In this article we develop and implement a context-driven, agent-based modeling approach that supports the explicit representation of situation-dependent information for decision making within dynamic spatial environments. This context-driven approach is characterized by the identification of primitive contextual elements, the organization of such elements into context patterns, and contextualized learning. We synthesize two existing frameworks for the representation of spatiotemporal context and extend them to include higher level constructs and feedback mechanisms needed for learning and adaptation. Contextualized information is organized, analyzed, and used by agents to enhance their problem-solving capabilities. Dynamically changing information relevant to the decision-making processes of agents is captured in this approach and used to drive spatiotemporal learning in agents. We examine the utility of this context-driven approach via an agent-based model of elk movement. Elk in this model are represented as contextually aware intelligent agents that learn optimal movement patterns and adapt to heterogeneous landscape dynamics. The internal and external stimuli received by elk during migration are incorporated into the representation of agent context. The context-driven approach, as experimental results indicate, provides solid support for the representation of individual-centric interactions within complex adaptive spatial systems. © 2010 by Association of American Geographers."

These studies identified critical factors influencing epidemic spread, but they also left important questions unanswered. The objective of this project was to design a more realistic agent-based model that would overcome limitations of earlier models and provide new insights into these outstanding questions. Methods: The new model extends the previous agent-based model to three communities so that results can be compared to those from the population-based model. Sensitivity testing was conducted, and the new model was used to investigate the influence of seasonal settlement and mobility patterns, the geographic heterogeneity of the observed 1918-1919 epidemic in Manitoba, and other questions addressed previously. Results: Results confirm outcomes from the population-based model that suggest that (a) social organization and mobility strongly influence the timing and severity of epidemics and (b) the impact of the epidemic would have been greater if it had arrived in the summer rather than the winter. New insights from the model suggest that the observed heterogeneity among communities in epidemic impact was not unusual and would have been the expected outcome given settlement structure and levels of interaction among communities. Conclusions: Application of an agent-based computer simulation has helped to better explain observed patterns of spread of the 1918-1919 flu epidemic in central Manitoba.

Complexity arises from interconnections between multiple and intertwined processes, affected by harsh climatic and soil conditions, cropping practices and labor migrations. Having faced a spatially heterogeneous and dynamic environment for centuries, local rice farmers are very adaptive and are used to adjusting their behavior in unpredictable climatic and economic conditions. Better understanding is needed to manage the key interactions between labor, land and water use for rice production, especially when major investments in new water infrastructure are now being considered. Based on the principles of the iterative and evolving Companion Modeling (ComMod) approach, indigenous and academic knowledge was integrated in an Agent-Based Model (ABM) co-designed with farmers engaged in different types of farming practices over a period of three years to create a shared representation of the complex and adaptive social-agroecological system in Ban Mak Mai village, in the south of Ubon Ratchathani province. The ABM consists of three interacting modules: Water (hydro-climatic processes), Rice, and Household. ""Household"" is a rule-based agent; it makes daily decisions based on its available means of production, taking into account the stage of the rice crop, and water and labor availability. Key decisions made are related to: i) rice nursery establishment, ii) rice transplanting, iii) rice harvesting, and iv) migration of household members. The spatially explicit model interface represents a virtual rainfed lowland rice environment as an archetypical toposequence made of upper to lower paddies in a mini-catchment farmed by 4 different households, and also includes water bodies and human settlements. Thanks to intensive communication, the participating farmers, made sure that the ABM adequately represents their rice farming and labor migration management practices.

Discussions among urban planners and policymakers in Europe have focused on the consequences of urban shrinkage following demographic transition, fertility decline and individualization. In this study, the shrinking city of Leipzig in Eastern Germany is singled out as a case basis for the study of residential mobility and land use change using agent-based modeling techniques, in which social scientists developed a concept of household types based on empirical data that form a unique base; these techniques were used to construct a data-driven, agent-based model. The spatially explicit simulation model RESMOB. city presented here 'translates' these empirical data via behavioral rules of households. It computes spatially explicit household patterns, housing demands and residential vacancies. Based on three scenarios, population growth, stagnation and shrinkage, we show that population might stabilize within the coming years. The number of households is expected to further increase. We demonstrate that a selective demolition of vacant housing stock can counteract the enormous oversupply of dwellings and better balance housing demand and the number of available flats. Scenario simulation shows that the model can reproduce observed patterns of population, inner-urban migration and residential vacancy in a spatially explicit manner and thus can be applied to the analysis of scenarios of demographic change in urban regions.

Invasive cluster formation has been assumed to be dependent on directed migration and a heterogeneous environment - a conclusion derived from complex models of tumor-environment interaction. At the same time, these models have not included the prospect, now supported by a preponderance of evidence, that only a minority of cancer cells may have stem cell capacity. This proves to weigh heavily on the microenvironmental requirements for the display of characteristic tumor growth phenotypes. We show using agent-based modeling that some defining features of tumor growth ascribed to directed migration might also be realized under random migration, and discuss broader implications for cause-and-effect determination in general.Results: Considering only the properties of random migration in tumors composed of stem cells and committed cells, we are able to recapitulate a characteristic clustering feature of invasive tumor growth, a property we attribute to ""self-metastatic"" growth. When the additional influence of directed migrations under chemotactic environments are considered, we find that tumor growth and invasive morphology are supported while the tumor is distant from the source, but are progressively discouraged as the tumor converges about that source.Conclusions: We show that invasive clustering can derive from basic kinetic assumptions often neglected in more complex models. While higher-order mechanisms, e.g. directed migration upon chemotactic stimuli, may result in clustering growth morphologies, exclusive attributions of this phenotype to this or other structured microenvironments would be inappropriate, in light of our finding these features are observable in a homogeneous environment. Furthermore, directed migration will result in loss of the invasive phenotype as the tumor approaches the attractor source.

These interactions can be mediated remotely by diffusive biochemical factors, or by direct cell-cell contact. E-cadherin is a protein expressed on the surface of normal epithelial cells that plays a key role in mediating intercellular adhesion via calcium-dependent homotypic interactions. E-cadherin is a metastasis-suppressor protein and its loss of function is associated with malignant progression. The purpose of this study was to apply an agent-based simulation paradigm in order to examine the emergent growth properties of mixed populations consisting of normal and E-cadherin defective cells in monolayer cell culture. Specifically, we have investigated the dynamics of normal cell:cell interactions in terms of intercellular adhesion and migration, and have used a simplified rule to represent the concepts of juxtacrine epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation and subsequent effect on cell proliferation. This cellular level control determines the overall population growth in a simulated experiment. Our approach provides a tool for modelling the development of defined biological abnormalities in epithelial and other biological tissues, raising novel predictions for future experimental testing. The results predict that even a relatively small number of abnormal ('anti-social') cells can modify the rate of the total population expansion, but the magnitude of this effect also depends on the extrinsic (culture) environment. In addition to directly influencing population dynamics, 'anti-social' cells can also disrupt the behaviour of the normal cells around them. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Modeling T-cell responses in lymph nodes now requires integration of cell trafficking and motility with the molecular processes involved in T-cell activation. We describe an agent-based model that allows such integration, in which T cells undertake a random walk through a three-dimensional representation of the lymph node paracortex, integrating signals from dendritic cells (DCs), and proliferating in response. The model accommodates simulation of a large number of T cells packed at realistic densities, and includes dynamic cell trafficking that allows the lymph nodes to swell and shrink as the immune response progresses. The results from the model, including the kinetics of cognate T-cell proliferation and release, and the changes in their avidity profile, are similar to those observed in vivo. We therefore propose that this modeling framework is capable of successfully simulating T-cell activation while also accounting for new spatiotemporal knowledge of how T cells and DCs interact. Although some of the parameters used to drive the model are not yet experimentally validated, the model is capable of testing the effects of alternative values for any parameter on the T-cell response.

This fieldwork led to build a set of rules for the behaviour of individuals in non-pastoralist villages. We implemented these rules into an agent-based model simulating three village archetypes. Each archetype includes biophysical, economical, social agricultural and livestock modules. Results from simulations with no social transition processes show that villages specialize themselves into different economic activities according to natural resource specificities: A decreasing intensification gradient is observed from the most favoured site, with more local productions and good ecological indicators, to the less-favoured site, with a growing proportion of the population wealth coming from migration remittances and "" off-shore"" livestock. Two family transition processes were implemented, following field observations and literature-based hypotheses: family organizations evolve between a patriarchal mode and a non-cooperative mode following tensions due to income redistribution. Family inheritance systems evolve from a "" customary"" one-heir mode to a "" local Muslim"" mode in which all males inherits land. This evolution depends on family tensions due to land availability. Once introducing these processes, the population of each site differentiates itself into specialized groups according to size, assets and social status.

Modeling MCBS requires incorporating these complex interactions among the individual cells and the environment. Modeling approaches for MCBS can be grouped into two categories: continuum models and cell-based models. Continuum models usually take the form of partial differential equations, and the model equations provide insight into the relationship among the components in the system. Cell-based models simulate each individual cell behavior and interactions among them enabling the observation of the emergent system behavior. This review focuses on the cell-based models of MCBS, and especially, the technical aspect of the rule-based simulation method for MCBS is reviewed. How to implement the cell behaviors and the interactions with other cells and with the environment into the computational domain is discussed. The cell behaviors reviewed in this paper are division, migration, apoptosis/necrosis, and differentiation. The environmental factors such as extracellular matrix, chemicals, microvasculature, and forces are also discussed.

In this bottom-up simulation approach, a landscape can be created and populated with a heterogeneous group of agents who move and interact in ways that more closely resemble human behavior than is usually seen in other modeling techniques. In this project, an agent-based model was constructed to simulate the spread of the 1918 influenza pandemic through the Norway House community in Manitoba, Canada. Archival, ethnographic, epidemiological, and biological information were used to aid in designing the structure of the model and to estimate values for model parameters. During the epidemic, Norway House was a Hudson's Bay Company post and a Swampy Cree-Métis settlement with an economy based on hunting, fishing, and the fur trade. The community followed a traditional, seasonal travel pattern of summer aggregation and winter dispersal. The model was used to examine how seasonal community structures and associated population movement patterns may have influenced disease transmission and epidemic spread. Simulations of the model clearly demonstrate that human behavior can significantly influence epidemic outcomes. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Many of these data are evaluated on the level of cells, resulting in a changed phenotype of cells. Tools are required to translate the information on the cellular scale to the whole tissue, wheremultiple interacting cell types are involved. Agent-based modeling allows the investigation of properties emerging from the collective behavior of individual units. A typical agent in biology is a single cell that transports information from the intracellular level to larger scales. Mainly, two scales are relevant: changes in the dynamics of the cell, e.g. surface properties, and secreted molecules that can have effects at a distance larger than the cell diameter."

Two family transition processes are here tested, following field observations and literature-based hypotheses: family organizations can evolve between a patriarchal mode and a non-cooperative one because of family income redistribution tensions. Family inheritance systems can shift between a ""customary"" mode and a ""local Muslim"" one through family land availability tensions. Our results show that both agro-ecological and socio-economic characteristics determine the simulated family type distribution and consequently the allocation of resources. Results from simulations with no evolution processes show that villages specialize themselves on different economic activities according to natural resources: An intensification gradient is observed from the most favored site, with more local productions and improved ecological indicators, to the less-favored one, with a growing proportion of the population wealth coming from migration remittances and ""off-shore"" livestock. Once introducing such processes, the differentiation also occurs within the population level, subdividing it into specializing groups according to their size, their assets and their social status. Emerging individualistic family types increase the village populations' robustness through different and site-specific evolutions."

The toolkit is normally used on a single workstation, where modelling, execution and visualization aspects are dealt with. This paper describes an approach aimed to distributing RePast models, with minimal changes, over a networked context so as to address very large and reconfigurable models whose computational needs (in space and time) can be difficult to satisfy on a single machine. Novel in the approach is an exploitation of a lean actor infrastructure implemented in Java. Actors bring to RePast agents migration, location-transparent naming, efficient communications, and a control-centric framework. Actors can be orchestrated by an in-thelarge custom control structure which can ensure the necessary message precedence constraints. Preliminary experience is being carried out using HLA/RTI as middleware. However, the realization can also work with other standard transport layers such as Java Socket and Java RMI.

The model incorporates differential income between two classes of agents, a simplified market mechanism for the purchase of housing, and a simple geographic structure of one central city and four symmetrically arranged suburbs. Agents derive utility from neighborhood racial composition, the size of their lot, private amenities that are specific to neighborhoods, and public amenities that stretch across municipalities. We find that the public-amenities term leads to a positive-feedback loop in which migration to suburbs increases the public amenities in those munic-ipalities while lowering amenities in the central city, thus sparking further migration. When the minority agents are uniformly less affluent than the majority agents, this dynamic produces disconti-nuity in segregation as measured by centralization. Such discontinuities are typical of first-order phase transitions. When minority and majority incomes overlap, significant regions appear over which there are multistable equilibria at high and low levels of segregation, along with considerable sensitivity to the initial distribution of minority agents. We discuss the implications of these findings.© 2009 Pion Ltd and its Licensors."

As a special feature, these models allow to account for intracellular decision processes which are triggered by biomechanical cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions. We discuss their impact on the growth and homeostasis of multi-cellular systems as simulated by lattice-free models. Our results demonstrate that cell polarisation subsequent to cell-cell contact formation can be a source of stability in epithelial monolayers. Stroma contact-dependent regulation of tumour cell proliferation and migration is shown to result in invasion dynamics in accordance with themigrating cancer stem cell hypothesis. However, we demonstrate that different regulation mechanisms can equally well comply with present experimental results.

Similarly, simulation of urban dynamics has been achieved with the use of Cellular Automata. In contrast to these approaches, agent-based simulation provides a much more powerful set of tools. This allows researchers to set up a counterpart for real environmental and urban systems in computer for experimentation and scenario analysis. This Paper basically reviews the research on the economic mechanism of urbanization and an agent-based monocentric model is setup for further understanding the urbanization process and mechanism in China. We build an endogenous growth model with dynamic interactions between spatial agglomeration and urban development by using agent-based simulation. It simulates the migration decisions of two main types of agents, namely rural and urban households between rural and urban area. The model contains multiple economic interactions that are crucial in understanding urbanization and industrial process in China.

One such calculus, called APi-calculus (an extension to Pi-calculus), provides extensive support for modeling migration, intelligence, natural grouping and security in agent-based systems [18].

Although an invaluable formal method for mobile agent systems, APi-calculus is quite complex (as are other calculi) and not very well suited to working with practical applications by itself. Due to the dynamic nature of mobile agents, a graphical program based on the mathematics of the calculus would enhance the use of the calculus and its attraction to the mobile agents industry. The ability to provide instant demonstration of a designed system to the user and the support for verification and validation of such systems specified by the calculus would prove to be a great asset for APi-calculus as well as agents-based computing in general.

Although various molecular factors that mediate alveolization have been identified, little is known about biological principles that drive the morphogenic processes. To help elucidate the operating principles governing the morphogenic behavior of pulmonary epithelial cells, we have developed an agent-based model of alveolar cells in culture. The model system comprises discrete components that represent individual cells and different elements of the extracellular environment. Individual cells are represented as independent agents that act based on a set of axioms (principles) that govern their interaction with the surroundings. Simulation of alveolar cell cultures confirms that the model is capable of generating phenotypic attributes similar to those of in vitro observations.

Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA 02129, United States","Background. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently overexpressed in many cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In silico modeling is considered to be an increasingly promising tool to add useful insights into the dynamics of the EGFR signal transduction pathway. However, most of the previous modeling work focused on the molecular or the cellular level only, neglecting the crucial feedback between these scales as well as the interaction with the heterogeneous biochemical microenvironment. Results. We developed a multiscale model for investigating expansion dynamics of NSCLC within a two-dimensional in silico microenvironment. At the molecular level, a specific EGFR-ERK intracellular signal transduction pathway was implemented. Dynamical alterations of these molecules were used to trigger phenotypic changes at the cellular level. Examining the relationship between extrinsic ligand concentrations, intrinsic molecular profiles and microscopic patterns, the results confirmed that increasing the amount of available growth factor leads to a spatially more aggressive cancer system. Moreover, for the cell closest to nutrient abundance, a phase-transition emerges where a minimal increase in extrinsic ligand abolishes the proliferative phenotype altogether. Conclusion. Our in silico results indicate that in NSCLC, in the presence of a strong extrinsic chemotactic stimulus (and depending on the cell's location) downstream EGFR-ERK signaling may be processed more efficiently, thereby yielding a migration-dominant cell phenotype and overall, an accelerated spatio-temporal expansion rate. © 2007 Wang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

In the ideal case emergent properties on the tissue scale can be derived from the cellular scale. However, this has been achieved in rare examples only, in particular, when involving high-speed migration of cells. One major difficulty is the lack of a suitable multiscale simulation platform, which embeds reaction diffusion of soluble substances, fast cell migration and mechanics, and, being of great importance in several tissue types, cell flow homeostasis. In this paper a step into this direction is presented by developing an agent-based mathematical model specifically designed to incorporate these features with special emphasis on high-speed cell migration. Cells are represented as elastic spheres migrating on a substrate in lattice-free space. Their movement is regulated and guided by chemoattractants that can be derived from the substrate. The diffusion of chemoattractants is considered to be slower than cell migration and, thus, to be far from equilibrium. Tissue homeostasis is not achieved by the balance of growth and death but by a flow equilibrium of cells migrating in and out of the tissue under consideration. In this sense the number and the distribution of the cells in the tissue is a result of the model and not part of the assumptions. For the purposes of demonstration of the model properties and functioning, the model is applied to a prominent example of tissue in a cellular flow equilibrium, the secondary lymphoid tissue. The experimental data on cell speed distributions in these tissues can be reproduced using reasonable mechanical parameters for the simulated cell migration in dense tissue. © 2007 The American Physical Society."

Macquart-Moulin & Ribera Maycas (1995) reported that the six most abundant species on western and southern European shelves are all strong diel migrators. Published daytime epibenthic sledge (sled) data from the surf zone to the shelf edge matched with published behavioural data on the most abundant species were used to test, confirm and extend that relationship to other coastal regions and to identify an association of abundant migrators with species that are important in fish diets. They also reveal another pattern: a correspondence between abundant surf-zone species and species that dominate estuarine faunas seasonally. Population concentrations at estuary mouths, sills of fjords and in the surf zone suggest a lifestyle dependent upon horizontal fluxes. Marine mysids that migrate between habitats are chronically undersampled in the field, however, and are underrepresented in food-web models. Unfortunately, no single methodology samples both pelagic and benthic individuals well and nearly all shelf measurements so far reported must be considered underestimates of local abundance. Mysids are major dietary components for many benthic and pelagic fishes, mammals, cephalopods and decapods, often for key life stages, and often because mysid migrations result in encounters with predators. Mysids can be extraordinarily omnivorous, with demonstrated capabilities to digest cellulose and diets spanning macrophyte detritus, more labile detritus, large microalgae, and smaller animals and heterotrophic protists. They can be sufficiently abundant and active to play roles in sediment transport. Contributing factors to their underappreciation have been the lack of fidelity of mysids to single habitats, coupled with higher fidelity of investigators to the study of single habitats. Sampling with classical methods has been problematic because of effective evasion by mysids, compounded by extreme patchiness associated with mysid schooling. Their frequent absence from coastal and even estuarine food-web models has not been more conspicuous because the combination of their migration and omnivory spreads their feeding impacts and because they are subsidised by horizontally imported plankton and seston and are themselves horizontally exported in the form of predator gut contents and biomass. They clearly link pelagic and benthic food webs in two important and ecosystem-stabilising ways, however, by feeding in both habitats and by succumbing in both habitats to both cruising and sitand-wait predators. Consideration of resource and predation gradients and limited data implicate horizontal, diel migrations as well, extending these linkages, especially in the onshore-offshore direction. Somewhat paradoxically, the same features that have made them difficult to study by classical means, in particular schooling, diet breadth, ontogenetic change in diet and migration between habitats, suit migrating mysids well to new, individual- or agent-based modelling approaches. Moreover, benthic observatories deploying acoustic technologies with spatial and temporal resolution sufficient to resolve individual migratory behaviours promise powerful tests of such models."

Folkman and colleagues (2) first identified a soluble growth-factor referred to as tumor-angiogenesis factor (TAF) produced by tumors that could induce the growth of such new capillaries. This in turn led to the concept of antiangiogenesis as tumor therapy (3). Experimental verification of this mechanism in a rabbit model (4), research discovering details of the cellular processes of tumor angiogenesis (5), and in vivo inhibition of tumor-induced angiogenesis (6) form the basis of most of the work that followed. In parallel to the experimental work, attempts were being made early on to mathematically model the endothelial cell (EC) sprouting, the interconnection and looping of blood vessels, and their growth toward the tumor induced by TAFs (7). Meanwhile, a model of the extravascular transport of reporter molecules in tumor and normal tissue showed a good fit to one-dimensional diffusion. Furthermore, real tumors were found to provide fewer hindrances to macromolecular transport by diffusion than were surrounding tissue (8).Modeling work that compared experimentally measured TAF profiles predicted that this factor could be secreted outside the neoplasm only after the tumor exceeds a threshold size (9). Patterns of angiogenesis have been examined subsequently using reaction diffusion simulations that focused (for example) on TAF diffusion (10). Furthermore, work by Byrne and Chaplain (11) examined the role of the migration rate of newly sprouted capillaries and its consequences on brush borders and the parameters contributing to successful vascularization of tumors. © Cambridge University Press 2007 and 2009."

In silico hypothesis testing indicated that cell-cell contact, cell-substrate contact, and differentiation of transit amplifying (TA) cells were major mechanisms, whereas cell cycle times of both stem and TA cells had no obvious effects on the pattern of NHK distribution. The model suggested that the limited divisional capability of TA cells wasn't an internal cell property but a statistical phenomenon. By deliberately omitting the rules for the stem cell colony autoregulation and for cell differentiation mechanism, the population growth of a transformed keratinocyte cell line (HaCat cells) was also successfully described. The model of NHKs was then used in a predictive sense. Simulation of scratch wounds made to NHK cells indicated that wound healing in low [Ca2+] media would be achieved mainly by migration and subsequent proliferation. In physiological [Ca2+] media, a stem cell position dependent wound closure pattern was predicted. Both were then validated by in vitro experiments designed to check the model's predictions.

In this paper we present LABORsim, an agent based microsimulation model of labour supply, which offers new insights on the likely evolution of the labour force in the next decades in Italy. LABORsim integrates the current demographic projections with simulation modules modelling retirement rules, retirement behaviours, migrations, education and participation choices, plus a consolle to implement various policy scenario analyses. When all these factors are taken into account, projections for next decades are not that pessimistic. In most scenarios, the overall participation rate is expected to increase steadily for the next two decades, while shortages in the labour force supply and an unfavourable dynamics for the economic dependency rate are expected to show up only after 2020, when the baby boom generations will arrive at their retirement ages. This is not enough, however, to allow Italy to meet the EU Stockholm and Lisbon targets for male and female employment rates for many decades to come. The sharp increase in the participation rates for the elderly (aged 55-64), mainly driven by the recent changes in the retirement eligibility criteria, will make it possible to meet the Stockholm target of 50% employment rate in this age group by 2015, i.e. with only 5 years of delay. © Springer 2006."

Here, we present a novel computational model simulating this cellular decision-process leading up to either phenotype based on a molecular interaction network of genes and proteins. The model's regulatory network consists of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), its ligand transforming growth factor-α (TGFα), the downstream enzyme phospholipaseC-γ (PLCγ) and a mitosis-associated response pathway. This network is activated by autocrine TGFα secretion, and the EGFR-dependent downstream signaling this step triggers, as well as modulated by an extrinsic nutritive glucose gradient. Employing a framework of mass action kinetics within a multiscale agent-based environment, we analyse both the emergent multicellular behavior of tumor growth and the single-cell molecular profiles that change over time and space. Our results show that one can indeed simulate the dichotomy between cell migration and proliferation based solely on an EGFR decision network. It turns out that these behavioral decisions on the single cell level impact the spatial dynamics of the entire cancerous system. Furthermore, the simulation results yield intriguing experimentally testable hypotheses also on the sub-cellular level such as spatial cytosolic polarization of PLCγ towards an extrinsic chemotactic gradient.

Three types of agents, namely Job Agents (JAs), Resource Brokering Agents (RBAs), and Resource Monitoring Agents (RMAs), are used. The JAs are mobile and they represent the users and perform tasks such as completing the job requests of the users and executing the jobs at suitable grid nodes. The RBAs are static and they act as resource schedulers as well as brokers for the users to submit their jobs through JAs. The RBAs incorporate an economic model and a queuing model. The RMAs are static and they reside in the nodes of the local clusters and inform the status of the resources to the local cluster servers. The model differs from other existing models, as it has the following characteristics: 1) topology-based migration of the agents, 2) analysis of different types of migrations according to the topology and the agents’ overheads, and 3) resource allocation based on dynamic pricing and negotiation. The model is evaluated in a simulated environment to investigate the behavior of several parameters. © 2005 - IOS Press and the authors."

Computational models of the behavior of epithelial cells in monolayer cell culture have been developed and used to predict the healing characteristics of scratch wounds made to urothelial cell cultures maintained in low- and physiological [Ca2+] environments. Both computational models and in vitro experiments demonstrated that in low exogenous [Ca2+], the closure of 500-μm scratch wounds was achieved primarily by cell migration into the denuded area. The wound healing rate in low (0.09 mM) [Ca2+] was approximately twice as rapid as in physiological (2 mM) [Ca2+]. Computational modeling predicted that in cell cultures that are actively proliferating, no increase in the fraction of cells in the S-phase would be expected, and this conclusion was supported experimentally in vitro by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assay. We have demonstrated that a simple rule-based model of cell behavior, incorporating rules relating to contact inhibition of proliferation and migration, is sufficient to qualitatively predict the calcium-dependent pattern of wound closure observed in vitro. Differences between the in vitro and in silico models suggest a role for wound-induced signaling events in urothelial cell cultures."

The MameLuke framework enhances the understanding of the relationship between societal processes and LUCC by modelling individual and group decisions and human-environment interactions.The framework allows for the transformation of real-life stories into computerised models following a predetermined sequence. By doing so, the framework allows for a truly integrative approach, because it is not bound to any particular scientific discourse. Even better, the framework enables its users to combine scientific discourses regarding human decisions and behaviour on multiple scales and levels.The agents (actors and locations) in the framework are heterogeneous. This heterogeneity of agent behaviour is established by dividing the agents into categories. If an agent is a member of an agent category or combination of categories, it has access to a defined set of implementable actions. The actions are constructed out of potential option paths (POPs) and potential option nodes (PONs). The whole of POPs represent a theoretical construct of agent behaviour and decisions that the framework user wishes to explore. The POP defines a sequence of PONs. The PON is a transaction interface between an initialising agent and a recipient agent where they exchange material and immaterial capital.This paper explains the basic architecture of the MameLuke framework and shows its applicability with a model of a Philippine case study. This case study concerns the dynamics of migration and deforestation. It is part of a larger study on land use change in the San Mariano watershed area at the forest fringe of the Sierra Madre mountains in the Philippines. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Environ. Research Institute, Grenåvej 14, DK-8410 Rønde, Denmark","Spatio-temporal factors strongly influence the population dynamics of animals; thus there have been calls to integrate these factors in environmental impact assessment of toxic compounds. To date, methodological difficulties have probably prevented this union. However, new modeling techniques that could help are available. This paper presents the construction and application of an agent-based simulation model of skylarks in agricultural landscapes and its use to assess the impact of pesticides relative to changes in landscape structure and mortality assumptions. Simulations indicated that pesticides had a negative impact on skylark population size. The annual reduction in numbers was variable and depended primarily upon migration mortality and an interaction between weather and pesticides. Altering landscape structure, crop diversity, or migration mortality assumptions resulted in a population change of approximately 37%, compared to a mean of 4% for pesticides. It was concluded that factors other than pesticides are likely to be limiting skylark numbers in most landscapes. This study demonstrates the importance of modeling the interactions between spatio-temporal environmental factors and the study organisms. Agent-based models (ABMs) are able to extract these relationships as emergent properties of their mechanistic nature. Therefore, we recommend the use of ABM models in future regulatory assessment of pesticides."

Very little is known, however, about the existence of structure-function relationships in these types of neoplasm. Therefore, using a previously developed two-dimensional agent-based model, we have investigated the emergent patterns of multiple tumor cells that proliferate and migrate on an adaptive grid lattice, driven by a local-search mechanism and guided by the presence of distinct environmental conditions. Numerical results indicate a strong correlation between the fractal dimensions of the tumor surface and the average velocity of the tumor's spatial expansion. In particular, when the so called 'beaten-path advantage' intensifies, i.e., rising 'mechanical rewards' for cells to follow each other along preformed pathways, it results in an increase of the tumor system's fractal dimensions leading to a concomitant acceleration of its spatial expansion. Whereas cell migration is the dominant phenotype responsible for the more extensive branching patterns exhibiting higher fractal dimensions, cell proliferation appears to become more active primarily at lower fracticality associated with stronger mechanical confinements. Implications of these results for experimental and clinical cancer research are discussed. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The agents in the model represent individuals in the five East German states who decide whether or not, when and whereto in the West to migrate. Agents respond to incentives provided by current and expected future unemployment and income differentials between states, moving costs and job search costs. Consistent with recent empirical evidence the simulation results show that agents who experience unemployment are more likely to emigrate. The large number of emigrants in the periods after the fall of the wall can be explained by an (initially) large number of very mobile individuals (e.g., young Easterners). Moreover, the predictions show that geographic proximity and the demand for technically skilled labor explain most of the observed distribution of migrants across west German states."

If an agent finds that the service roundtrip time (RTT) is too long, then it may try to cut it down by migrating to another idle node. Since migration is an expensive activity, the agent should decide correctly before making the move. One way of achieving sound decision making is to measure the mean RTT of the channel and to ensure that the RTT up-trend is not a transient phenomenon. The M3RT works on past history accumulated since the commencement of the channel operation. It never has computation overflow because of it integral nature. In the M3RT development process the corresponding time/stochastic Petri net model was built for exhaustive verification. The aim is to ensure that convergence stability exists under all conditions. The input waveforms used in the simulations mimic the dynamic reality of a sizeable network such as the Internet.

The first finding is the positive results of the docking study with the crystal structures of A<sub>2A</sub> adenosine (A2AAR) and acetylcholine esterase (AChE) receptors. A2AAR is a member of non-dopaminergic GPCR superfamily receptor proteins and has essential role in regulation of glutamate and dopamine release in Parkinson’s disease while AChE plays a major role in Alzheimer’s disease as the primary enzyme responsible for the hydrolytic metabolism of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into choline and acetate. Docking showed that OMR perfectly fits into A2AAR binding pocket forming a distinctive hydrogen bond with Threonine 256. Besides other non-polar interactions inside the pocket suggesting the future of the marketed anti-diabetic drug (that cross BBB) as a potential antiparkinsonian agent while OMR showed perfect fit inside AChE receptor binding site smoothly because of its optimum length and the two fluorine atoms that enables quite lean fitting. Moreover, a computational comparative study of OMR docking, other 12 DPP-4 inhibitors and 11 SGLT-2 inhibitors was carried out. Secondly, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) concentration in rats’ brain tissue was determined by the authors using sandwich GLP-1 ELISA kit bio-analysis to ensure the effect of OMR after the multiple doses’ study. Brain GLP-1 concentration was elevated by 1.9-fold following oral multiple doses of OMR (5 mg/kg/day, p.o. for 28 days) as compared to the control group. The third finding is the enhanced BBB crossing of OMR after 28 days of multiple doses that had been studied using <i>LC</i>-MS/MS method with enhanced liquid–liquid extraction. A modified LC-MS/MS method was established for bioassay of OMR in rats’ plasma (10–3100 ng/mL) and rats’ brain tissue (15–2900 ng/mL) using liquid–liquid extraction. Alogliptin (ALP) was chosen as an internal standard (IS) due to its LogP value of 1.1, which is very close to the LogP of OMR. Extraction of OMR from samples of both rats’ plasma and rats’ brain tissue was effectively achieved with ethyl acetate as the extracting solvent after adding 1N sodium carbonate to enhance the drug migration, while choosing acetonitrile to be the diluent solvent for the IS to effectively decrease any emulsion between the layers in the stated method of extraction. Validation results were all pleasing including good stability studies with bias of value below 20%. Concentration of OMR in rats’ plasma were determined after 2 h of the latest dose from 28 days multiple doses, p.o, 5 mg/kg/day. It was found to be 1295.66 ± 684.63 ng/mL estimated from the bio-analysis regression equation. OMR passed through the BBB following oral administration and exhibited concentration of 543.56 ± 344.15 ng/g in brain tissue, taking in consideration the dilution factor of 10. The brain/plasma concentration ratio of 0.42 (543.56/1295.66) was used to illustrate the penetration power through the BBB after the multiple doses for 28 days. Results showed that OMR passed through the BBB more effectively in the multiple dose study as compared to the previously published single dose study by the authors. Thus, the present study suggests potential repositioning of OMR as antiparkinsonian agent that will be of interest for researchers interested in neurodegenerative diseases."

Ethnicity is one of the host factors which was the most studied factor overseas. The prevalence of H. pylori infection was found higher in certain ethnic such among Chinese. Based on migration and transmission theory, it was suspected that H. pylori infection was transmitted by people migrating from areas with a high prevalence of infection to the destination area. Chinese in West Borneo are originated from South China region where the prevalence of H. pylori infection is high. It is estimated that there are differences in the prevalence of H. pylori infection among Chinese compared to the native people of West Borneo, the Dayaknese.

Methods. This was a cross-sectional study to determine the differences in the prevalence of H. pylori infection. The study was conducted at St. Antonius General Hospital Pontianak from December 2014 to June 2015 with consecutive sampling method. H. pylori infection prevalence is presented in percentage numbers, while the epidemiological characteristics and endoscopic finding differences among Chinese and Dayaknese were analyzed by bivariate analysis using the chi-square with significance value (p) = 0.05.

Results. From a total of 203 subjects in this study, consisted of 102 Chinese subjects and 101 Dayaknese subjects, the prevalence of H. pylori infection was 40.8%. The prevalence among Chinese is higher than Dayaknese, which is 48.0% and 33.7%, respectively. There is no difference in the epidemiological characteristics and endoscopic findings in both ethnic groups.

Herein, a novel COX-2 probe (CCY-5) with high targeting ability and a near-infrared wavelength (achieved by attaching a CY-5 dye on the pyrazole ring of celecoxib using a migration strategy) was evaluated for its ability to probe COX-2 in human cancer cells. CCY-5 is expected to have high binding affinity for COX-2 based on molecular docking and enzyme inhibition assay. Meanwhile, CCY-5 caused stronger fluorescence imaging of COX-2 overexpressing cancer cells (Hela and SCC-9 cells) than that of normal cell lines (RAW 264.7 cells). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treated RAW264.7 cells revealed an enhanced fluorescence as LPS was known to induce COX-2 in these cells. In inhibitory studies, a markedly reduced fluorescence intensity was observed in cancer cells, when they were co-treated with a COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib. Therefore, CCY-5 may be a selective bioimaging agent for cancer cells overexpressing COX-2 and could be useful as a good monitoring candidate for effective diagnosis and therapy in cancer treatment."

Consequently, patients may be exposed to risk. There are few diagnoses based on in vitro tests, and there are almost no relevant studies.
Methods:: Authors examined involvement of allergic reaction using the leukocyte migration test (LMT) through multiple standpoints in 43 patients who underwent suspected diagnosis of allergy to ALAs.
Results:: Rate of LMT-positives was 54%, and especially the positive rate of lidocaine hydrochloride preparations was significantly high. In 15 positives to lidocaine hydrochloride preparations, all cases were indicated as positive in a test with drugs containing antiseptic agent, but only 3 cases were indicated as positive in a test with lidocaine hydrochloride alone. In addition, test with paraben was conducted in 4 cases; 2 cases were confirmed as positive. In relevance of histories of drug or food allergies, development rates of ALAs-allergies were the highest in both allergies, and were 35% and 13%, respectively.
Conclusions:: There is a high possibility that these adverse reactions were caused by pseudoallergy to drug. Even by allergic reactions, it was assumed that 80% of them might be caused by antiseptic agents such as paraben. In addition, it was suggested that ALAs, especially lidocaine hydrochloride preparations have high antigenicity (sensitizing property). Furthermore, it was considered that patients with past history of drug or food allergies have a high potential for manifestation of the reactions."

Herein, we proposed a facile methodology to prepare a gradient polysulfone-based (PSf) UF membrane with effective antifouling properties via coupling magnetic field-assisted directional migration and in-situ hydrolysis of fluoro-agent during non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS). The effect of GO-Fe3O4 gradient distribution and fluorosilane (FAS) in-situ surface modification on membrane morphology, hydrophilicity, porosity, water flux and antifouling properties have been investigated. Optical microscopy and SEM-EDX observations indicated that hydrophilic GO-Fe3O4 nanofiller could directionally migrate in casting solution and eventually result in gradient distribution in PSf matrix under the magnetic field. In addition, the surface enrichment of GO-Fe3O4 provided reaction sites to anchor low energy FAS via in-situ hydrolysis on the membrane surface and realized dual antifouling mechanism (fouling-resistance and fouling-release), which guaranteed UF membranes with excellent antifouling properties and remarkable long-term stability and reusability. Our study provided a new incentive to the development of high performance UF membranes by coupling magnetic migration and in-situ surface modification."

The pathologic hallmark of Mtb infection in humans and Non-Human Primates (NHPs) is the formation of spherical structures, primarily in lungs, called granulomas. Infection occurs after inhalation of bacteria into lungs, where resident antigen-presenting cells (APCs), take up bacteria and initiate the immune response to Mtb infection. APCs traffic from the site of infection (lung) to lung-draining lymph nodes (LNs) where they prime T cells to recognize Mtb. These T cells, circulating back through blood, migrate back to lungs to perform their immune effector functions. We have previously developed a hybrid agent-based model (ABM, labeled GranSim) describing in silico immune cell, bacterial (Mtb) and molecular behaviors during tuberculosis infection and recently linked that model to operate across three physiological compartments: lung (infection site where granulomas form), lung draining lymph node (LN, site of generation of adaptive immunity) and blood (a measurable compartment). Granuloma formation and function is captured by a spatio-temporal model (i.e., ABM), while LN and blood compartments represent temporal dynamics of the whole body in response to infection and are captured with ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In order to have a more mechanistic representation of APC trafficking from the lung to the lymph node, and to better capture antigen presentation in a draining LN, this current study incorporates the role of dendritic cells (DCs) in a computational fashion into GranSim. Results: The model was calibrated using experimental data from the lungs and blood of NHPs. The addition of DCs allowed us to investigate in greater detail mechanisms of recruitment, trafficking and antigen presentation and their role in tuberculosis infection. Conclusion: The main conclusion of this study is that early events after Mtb infection are critical to establishing a timely and effective response. Manipulating CD8+ and CD4+ T cell proliferation rates, as well as DC migration early on during infection can determine the difference between bacterial clearance vs. uncontrolled bacterial growth and dissemination."

Although transmission is thought to be highly heterogeneous in both space and time, little is known about the patterns and drivers of transmission in groups of houses in endemic settings. We carried out surveys of PCR positivity in children residing in 2-block patches of highly endemic cities of Colombia. We found high levels of heterogeneity in PCR positivity, varying from less than 30% in 8 of the 10 patches to 56 and 96%, with the latter patch containing 22 children simultaneously PCR positive (PCR22) for DEN2. We then used an agent-based model to assess the likely eco-epidemiological context of this observation. Our model, simulating daily dengue dynamics over a 20 year period in a single two block patch, suggests that the observed heterogeneity most likely derived from variation in the density of susceptible people. Two aspects of human adaptive behavior were critical to determining this density: external social relationships favoring viral introduction (by susceptible residents or infectious visitors) and immigration of households from non-endemic areas. External social relationships generating frequent viral introduction constituted a particularly strong constraint on susceptible densities, thereby limiting the potential for explosive outbreaks and dampening the impact of heightened vectorial capacity. Dengue transmission can be highly explosive locally, even in neighborhoods with significant immunity in the human population. Variation among neighborhoods in the density of local social networks and rural-to-urban migration is likely to produce significant fine-scale heterogeneity in dengue dynamics, constraining or amplifying the impacts of changes in mosquito populations and cross immunity between serotypes."

ABSTRACT


Since 2008, an average of twenty million people per year have been displaced by weather events. Climate migration creates a special setting for a duty to rescue. A duty to rescue is a moral rather than legal duty and imposes on a bystander to take an active role in preventing serious harm to someone else. This paper analyzes the idea of expanding a duty to rescue to climate migration. We address who should have the duty and to whom the duty should extend. The paper discusses ways to define and apply the duty to rescue as well as its limitations, arguing that it may take the form of an ethical duty to prepare. 


INTRODUCTION


Climate migration creates a special setting for a duty to rescue. A duty to rescue is a moral rather than legal duty and imposes on a bystander to take an active role in preventing serious harm to someone else. Examples of circumstances range from person-to-person intimate rescue to saving those in poverty, even in distant parts of the world.[1]


Since 2008, an average of twenty million people per year have been displaced by weather events.[2] Circumstances like being thrust from homes under the threat of fire, mudslide, and flooding vary greatly from long-term changes like land becoming too arid for crops or temperatures increasing annually gradually pushing up the number of heat-related deaths, with the area slowly becoming uninhabitable. Imminence in fleeing affects resettling and need for rescue with important implications for how the duty to rescue might apply.


This paper reevaluates the ethical framing of the duty to rescue and, while it is arguably a stretch, applies it to climate migration.  Climate migration has become common and is expected to increase due to rises in sea level, increases in weather events that make areas uninhabitable, and changes to land that preclude farming or other necessary land uses. We argue that a duty to rescue may help highlight who has moral obligations to whom.  Because the problem is so large in scope, we suggest a change in the ethical limits to humans' duty to rescue other humans who are in distress. We imagine an expansion or extension of the duty to rescue to meet some of the basic needs created by climate migration. Yet how it should expand, and how much depend on ethical framing and practical limitations.


l.     Expanding the Geographical Boundaries


Two commonly recognized emergencies, Hurricane Katrina in the case of weather events and the current COVID-19 pandemic, provide a historical and current backdrop to evaluate ethical obligations as more disasters displace people. A significant reassessment of the ethical scope of an obligation to rescue in the case of weather events will be limited by the ability to render aid to those in distress in the case of a planet-wide weather catastrophe. The problems may overwhelm the ability to rescue or the reasonableness of attempting rescue.


The extent of the moral obligation borne by humans to other humans in the case of a weather event has been largely defined by its locality and limited geographic influence. Whether we are imagining the scope of ethical obligation in the case of hurricane, flood, tornado, drought, or wildfire events, the perceived ethical obligation is significantly defined by the limited impact of these weather events on people outside the zone of the weather event's direct impact, yet close to that zone. A hurricane affecting New Orleans will not have immediate impact on the residents of California or even those on the northeast coast of the United States until a later time. Wildfires in the Pacific Northwest do not impair the ability of those in the rest of the country to come forward with assistance. But as climate migration crosses international borders, and climate events occur simultaneously in many regions, a more expansive duty to rescue may provide the ethical impulse to help those who live afar or migrate long distances. 


In this respect, the need for help in the event of widespread climate migration due to global warming is more like a pandemic than a weather event. Its broad impact area diminishes the capability of nearly the entire balance of the human population to help due to those populations' awareness that they will, in short order, have the same need for the same resources, from the same cause. Those living near current flood zones may find their historically safe havens are also a flood zone. Those previously best positioned to rescue may find themselves also needing to relocate. Thus, we may observe the need for new rescuers.


ll.     The Rule of Rescue


The Rule of Rescue as defined by Al Jonsen describes the moral impetus or knee jerk reaction to save identifiable people facing death.[3] A duty to rescue has since been expanded beyond imminent death and beyond the near and identifiable. But there are limitations. For example, by most accounts, the ethical duty tends not to require extreme bodily risk or financial depletion. In comparing Good Samaritans to humanitarians, Scott M. James argues the duty to rescue arises from unique dependence, but the ethical obligation to help strangers through humanitarian aid is of a different nature.[4] The wrongness of failing to help is arguably more egregious when one is in a unique position to help. Like in the tragedy of the commons, where there is no unique positioning, when the global community is called upon to help, each individual in it may feel less obliged to do so. Climate migration falls in between—it requires helping strangers, yet it may move forward without anyone seeing themselves as uniquely positioned to help until those strangers become part of communities, at which time, there may be more moral justification to help a community member in need.


Generally, arguments about Good Samaritans hinge on extraordinary acts, praiseworthy because they are acts of compassion, not obligation. Now all US states have Good Samaritan laws[5] which protect helpers from liability for help gone wrong or for a failure to succeed once engaged in an act of rescue. Extraordinary help as a moral good is thus somewhat encouraged through legal protection, but not imposed. Conversely, jobs like firefighting, search and rescue, and emergency medical care tend to oblige employees to take on risks that would be extraordinary if undertaken by the average bystander, yet they are rendered ordinary rescue as part of the job. Three states, Minnesota, Rhode Island, and Vermont have a broad duty to rescue, adding legal considerations to an otherwise moral conundrum. The laws do not require bystanders to take on risk for the sake of rescuing strangers.[6] The moral duty will require looking beyond law, but it is unclear how the moral duty to rescue should be distributed in the case of climate migration. A bare minimum would prevent taking advantage of newcomers, paying sub-minimum wage, and discriminating against them. Yet such a minimum is hardly rescue.


lll.     An Ethical Rather than Legal Duty


The difficulty in defining the duty to rescue as a legal obligation is that it is difficult to determine the extent of risk a rescuer ought to be required to take. The nature of this ethical duty is also arguably tied to the experiences of both the rescuer and the rescued. There are subjective aspects like what someone perceives as a danger that make it difficult to write enforceable laws requiring rescue. It is one thing to expect a rescuer to step into several inches of relatively warm water to lift a person lying face down in a pond and enable them to breathe. It is something altogether different to expect that rescuer to dive into frigid water and attempt to extricate someone trapped in a submerged automobile. As the legal philosopher H.L.A. Hart observed, it is always easier to define application of the core intention of any rule, whether law or ethical norm. It is more difficult to create legal certainty about how the law applies to what he described as “penumbra circumstances”. In the case of a hurricane, it is easier to define what surplus resources are available in areas geographically remote from the impact of the storm and demand, as a moral obligation, that those nearby but outside the area provide assistance. It is more difficult to obligate people, organizations, or governments to supply a quantity of medication or some number of ventilators to an adjacent community when they expect to imminently need them for their own community.


In the early stages of climate migration, the ethics of extreme weather event assistance, a common application of the duty to rescue, will be useful and appropriate. The rising sea levels first experienced by island nations in the South Pacific[7] will not render those living in other coastal communities, those with greater available “high ground”, unable to supply resources to those in need. But when sea level rise and climate change affect more communities simultaneously, albeit in varying degree, the task of defining what response is ethically obligatory becomes increasingly complicated. Pinpointing the obligations of those communities which are resource rich to those communities which are resource deprived, and of those partly affected to those more severely affected may become necessary.  The limitations of the traditional duty to rescue could expand to meet the needs.


lV.     Contribution to the Problem


Many argue that the duty to rescue may depend on any appropriate claim of those needing rescue. One issue is whether preferential claims among those who can identify the source of the harm should call for a greater duty or whether everyone in need should be approached as like candidates for rescue, shaping the duty as equal across those on the receiving end. As climate change does have human-made causes, there are strong arguments to impose a greater ethical duty on any entity that caused the climate-related problems leading to the mass exodus. While the global north is often implicated in pollution that causes migration, industries like energy, transportation, and agriculture are tied to climate change and associated with significant greenhouse gas emissions.[8] Practices like directing agriculture to less sustainable single crop growth generally made land less farmable. Yet it is difficult to place blame and identify specific causal relationships as most migration is due to many factors. A movement toward greater accountability can be reframed as a greater duty to rescue, a duty to engage in the extraordinary. The fossil fuel industry, for example, should have a larger obligation than the average person. Similarly, some may argue anyone unjustly enriching themselves while contributing to climate change or people who over-consume have an elevated duty to rescue.[9] Climate change lawsuits demonstrate an eagerness to hold governments and corporations accountable, despite difficulty proving causation.


V.     The Most Vulnerable


One ethical dimension of climate migration that remains unexplored is how a duty to rescue applies to vulnerable populations who stand to be left behind or unable to migrate without assistance. Researchers from the Global North working across the Global South are increasingly observing the phenomenon of ethics dumping, where the research ethics of some countries are imposed on research subjects in other countries.[10] In that vein, rescuers should be careful not to impose unwelcome cultural standards or exploit people who are in the process of migrating. There is a gap in discussions reflecting voices that have been left out. The duty to rescue is incomplete without an attempt to understand the ethical experiences of those being rescued. The actual people affected by climate migration who are the least likely to have the means to migrate, or to do so without extreme hardship, should have a voice informing the global community including those in a position to carry out rescue. People who have the means and are young and healthy may easily make decisions to avoid the catastrophic consequences that climate migration brings. However, what about those who are left behind? For example, especially recognizing cultural differences, the homeless community, disabled community, refugees, the elderly community, and women[11] and children may suffer differently and call for more attention. In some parts of the world, human rights are severely constrained. An ethical duty to rescue, with many considerations and variables, may be more justified in the case of those most in need. As climate migration continues and increases significantly, it may be reasonable to ask the local and global community to focus on those least well positioned to migrate successfully. In this context, the use of phenomenology to understand the lived experiences of those migrating, sometimes termed “ethical experiences”, may help flesh out how a duty to rescue takes shape. The discussion of duty and obligation requires an articulation of the ethical experiences (how the local community in need of rescue views the proposed rescue).  Then, the obligation to interpret the duty as ‘one shall not’ or ‘one must’ can be focused on the migrants’ needs rather than the rescuers’ feelings of obligation.[12] A revised theory of the duty to rescue taking into account the asymmetrical experiences of communities involved could ensure that the needs of people whose living situations, gender, ethnicity, age, or race impact their ability to even begin the migration process are considered.


In this discussion, the rescuing is directed toward communities /collectives of persons migrating, whether at once or across a period of time. Often, the climate migrant may not be in a state to articulate the nature of this event when it happens, given its subjective proximity. Yet, when communities are given the space and opportunity to articulate their shared values, the ethical action of rescue derives its meaningfulness from the community rather than the rescuers.  In other words, allowing climate migrants to explain their feelings can add complexity to what some see as a binary receiver-giver (of rescue) dynamic.


This is necessary because the concept of vulnerable populations is fraught with problematic assumptions. There have been various definitions and criteria to determine what would constitute vulnerable populations.[13] For example, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change[14] identifies and assesses vulnerable populations. These criteria may be helpful. However, they do not provide the full picture. Rather than identifying categorical criteria of vulnerable populations, engaging with people who are experiencing climate migration and listening to their current experiences and concerns helps determine need. Knowing what people need may prevent the kneejerk reaction to label people who are quite resilient yet have appropriate needs “vulnerable”.


Proceeding with caution is important because the duty to rescue has hierarchical underpinnings of ""us"" and ""them."" Often when people swoop in to save, there are good and bad consequences of the intervention. We should proceed with caution because often the helper misses the actual needs of those in need. The only way to combat this would be to make sure that people are empowered to inform those agencies that are able to help. 


In addition to more practical approaches, large scale oral histories could allow those who have migrated already to share their experiences. It would be important to capture the lived experiences of people who are already experiencing the consequences of climate migration or of other migration like that due to political or economic extreme events. These experiences could shape our analysis of whether people in fact wish for rescue. If so, further conversations can determine best actions as well as give important insight into what resources might be necessary to empower people now and in the future. 


Vl.     A Duty to Rescue as a Duty to Prepare


If we view Good Samaritans as going above and beyond, then a duty to rescue, something ethically compelled, must bring rescue out of the framework of charity and place it in the context of humanity and obligations. Such a view would also support expanding the geographical reach of the otherwise more proximate duty. The duty may be stronger and take shape in a more workable way if it applies to preparing places expecting to see an influx of people due to climate migration and to helping those most in need. The duty may arise out of expectations of what type of community the place welcoming those migrating due to climate should be—does it want to offer good housing, schooling, and medical care as well as economic opportunity to new people? And if so, at what cost, or with which risks? If the newcomers are viewed as community members rather than strangers, a model of acceptance may lead to better preparation. Some considerations like whether the actions will reasonably help the persons in need of rescue[15] will shape the application of a duty to rescue in the context of climate migration. Similarly, ensuring that people have the chance to articulate their values may help communities support the newcomers. New relationships should not be defined as migrant and rescuer.


Voluntariness in participation and not forcing any action deemed rescue would help ensure the human rights of those migrating. In the United States, President Biden issued an executive order addressing impending climate migration steeped in a duty to prepare by making plans for resettlement and to address the impact of climate migration.[16]


Vll.     At What Risk?


As we investigate the ethical obligations to meet even basic needs, we must also ask what level of risk is ethically compelled. There is an extraordinary need to integrate newcomers successfully, but it is difficult to stretch an ethical duty to rescue to require all the prerequisites for successful climate migration. Even defining success would create deep ethical arguments. As observed in almost all migrations, extraordinary charitable acts may be the key to success, while an ethical duty to rescue must try to require the important government and community-based basics and ensuring respect for human rights. That is, the migrating people should be rescued from circumstances that contradict basic human rights.


Rather than comparing communities to bystanders, mere places where people will arrive and need to hash out how to find housing, jobs, education, and opportunity, a duty of preparation may be the key to rescue those disenfranchised by migration. There are cultural, personal, physical, psycho-social, and geopolitical issues surrounding how to best help those needing to permanently relocate. Ethics arguments will certainly range from “do nothing”, which may fail people, to “do everything”, which could waste taxpayer money in futile over-preparation while failing to actually help. Communities must avoid planning exclusively for one scenario only to have it not take place. Striking the balance, a duty to rescue as it could apply to climate migration should set goals of societal integration, and providing the basics like education, housing, food, health care, and job opportunity, the precursors to flourishing. Recommending the extraordinary, morally preferred but perhaps not compulsory, when charitable actors are participating, or when wrongdoers are compensating, may be more workable than seeing the duty to rescue as compelling people or local governments to take on significant financial and personal risk for newcomers. While humanitarian ethics supports helping everyone, it is likely that people who resettle in advance of a need to flee will find themselves with more choices and opportunities. Help is warranted for those with more dire needs. Preparing for them may do just that.


Vlll.     Rescue Prior to Migration and Rescue in the Process of Resettlement


The duty to enable the migration in the first-place hints to the inadequacy of a duty to prepare. The traditional duty to rescue perhaps steps in if rescue looks like those geographically just out of harm's way rescuing those in danger. That resembles the traditional moral requirement, or duty to rescue according to the Rule of Rescue. Humanitarian aid typically provided by many institutions makes sense and is in place, although financial support for additional humanitarian aid is always needed. Despite having moved to purportedly more capable communities, migrant communities may be able to develop more egalitarian orders of living.  Rather than continually being identified as having been rescued, it is important to make sure people keep or make social ties during and after migration.  Immigrants often face social isolation.[17] Small shifts in gestural language also have the potential to welcome people and show they are valued. For instance, some migrants may not like questions like “Where are you from?” and “What brings you here?” as they emphasize differences over fitting in.


CONCLUSION


The ethical duty to rescue should be expanded to better match those in need of relocation with a welcome environment and the resources needed to achieve success and fully integrate socially and culturally. Expanding a dialogue that includes the voices of people who have recently migrated whether due to violence, poverty, or climate, could properly frame the extent of the duty. If we are to apply the duty of rescue to climate migration, rescuers should avoid labeling people vulnerable, dependent, or needy, although there is reason to focus on those whose needs are the most dire. A soft duty to rescue people during the course of climate migration can come in the form of preparation. People will need help finding housing, education, access to food, and employment. Ultimately, to help them help themselves may be the best goal. While the obligations should be borne differently by people, whether due to a special responsibility, or a special relationship that creates a clearer duty, the global community must prepare for its role in rescuing those displaced by climate events. By helping those displaced at the start of the climate migration process according to a more commonly held notion of the duty to rescue, and by preparing to incorporate newcomers successfully according to an expanded duty to rescue, effectively a duty to prepare, countries that take on climate refugees may find themselves rewarded by the cultural diversity and workplace talents that people bring. A duty to those at a distance is a reasonable expansion of the duty to rescue. But what one ought to do in the global community varies somewhat from the traditional Rule of Rescue.

VlsE, a 35 kDa surface-exposed lipoprotein, undergoes antigenic variation during B. burgdorferi infection of mammalian hosts, and is believed to be a critical mechanism by which the spirochetes evade immune clearance. Random, segmental recombination between the expressed vlsE gene and adjacent vls silent cassettes generates a large number of different VlsE variants within the infected host. Although the occurrence and importance of vlsE sequence variation is well established, little is known about the biological mechanism of vlsE recombination. To identify factors important in antigenic variation and vlsE recombination, we screened transposon mutants of genes known to be involved in DNA recombination and repair for their effects on infectivity and vlsE recombination. Several mutants, including those in BB0023 (ruvA), BB0022 (ruvB), BB0797 (mutS), and BB0098 (mutS-II), showed reduced infectivity in immunocompetent C3H/HeN mice. Mutants in ruvA and ruvB exhibited greatly reduced rates of vlsE recombination in C3H/HeN mice, as determined by restriction fragment polymorphism (RFLP) screening and DNA sequence analysis. In severe combined immunodeficiency (C3H/scid) mice, the ruvA mutant retained full infectivity; however, all recovered clones retained the 'parental' vlsE sequence, consistent with low rates of vlsE recombination. These results suggest that the reduced infectivity of ruvA and ruvB mutants is the result of ineffective vlsE recombination and underscores the important role that vlsE recombination plays in immune evasion. Based on functional studies in other organisms, the RuvAB complex of B. burgdorferi may promote branch migration of Holliday junctions during vlsE recombination. Our findings are consistent with those in the accompanying article by Dresser et al., and together these studies provide the first examples of trans-acting factors involved in vlsE recombination."

The TCP congestion control process is abstracted as a partially observed Markov decision process. In this process, an agent is constructed to interact with the network environment. The agent adjusts the size of the congestion window by observing the characteristics of the network state. The network environment feeds back the reward to the agent, and the agent tries to maximize the expected reward in an episode. We designed a weighted reward function to balance the throughput and delay. Compared with traditional Q-learning, DQN uses double-layer neural networks and experience replay to reduce the oscillation problem that may occur in gradient descent. We implemented the TCP-DQN method and compared it with mainstream congestion control algorithms such as cubic, Highspeed and NewReno. The results show that the throughput of TCP-DQN can reach more than 2 times of the comparison method while the latency is close to the three compared methods."

Though, quercetin possesses great medicinal value, its applications as a therapeutic drug are limited. Problems like low oral bioavailability and poor aqueous solubility make quercetin an unreliable candidate for therapeutic purposes. Additionally, the rapid gastrointestinal digestion of quercetin is also a major barrier for its clinical translation. Hence, to overcome these disadvantages quercetin-based nanoformulations are being considered in recent times. Nanoformulations of quercetin have shown promising results in its uptake by the epithelial system as well as enhanced delivery to the target site.

With careful treatment duration control, He/Ar-CAPJ effectively induced keratinocyte proliferation and migration mediated through the activation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell cycle progression, which was evidenced by a decrease in E-cadherin levels and increases in N-cadherin, cyclin D1, Ki-67, Cdk2, and p-ERK levels.

Latest researches show that conductive composite materials may make endogenous/exogenous electrical stimulation more effective, guide/comb cell migration to the wound, and subsequently promote wound healing. To accelerate infected wound healing, a novel medical silver nanoparticle-doped conductive polymer-based hydrogel system (Ag NPs/CPH) dressing with good conductivity, biocompatibility, and mechanical and antibacterial properties was fabricated. For the hydrogel dressing, Ag NPs/CPH, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and gelatin were used as the host matrix materials, and phytic acid (PA) was used as the cross-linking agent to introduce conductive polyaniline into the matrix, with antibacterial Ag NPs loaded via impregnation. After a series of analyses, the material containing 5 wt% of PVA by concentration, 1.5 wt% gelatin, 600 μL of AN reactive volume, and 600 μL of PA reactive volume was chosen for Ag NPs/CPH preparation. XPS and FTIR analysis had been further used to characterize the composition of the prepared Ag NPs/CPH. The test on the swelling property showed that the hydrogels had abundant pores with good water absorption (≈140% within 12 h). They can be loaded and continuously release Ag NPs. Thus, the prepared Ag NPs/CPH showed excellent antibacterial property with increasing duration of immersion of Ag NPs. Additionally, to evaluate in vivo safety, CCK-8 experiments of HaCat, LO2 and 293T cells were treated with different concentrations of the Ag NPs/CPH hydrogel soaking solution. The experimental results showed the Ag NPs/CPH had no significant inhibitory effect on any of the cells. Finally, an innovative infection and inflammation model was designed to evaluate the prepared Ag NPs/CPH hydrogel dressing for the treatment of severely infected wounds. The results showed that even when infected with bacteria for long periods of time (more than 20 h), the proposed conductive antibacterial hydrogel could treat severely infected wounds."

Repeated use of GBCAs causes their deposition in the brain. Such deposition may affect various neuronal cells, including astrocytes. In this study, we examined the effect of GBCAs (Omniscan, Magnescope, Magnevist, and Gadovist) on astrocyte migration, which is critical for formation of neurons during development and maintaining brain homeostasis. All GBCAs increased cell migration and adhesion with increased actin remodelling. Knockdown of integrin αvβ3 by RNAi or exposure to integrin αvβ3 inhibitor reduced astrocyte migration. GBCAs increased phosphorylation of downstream factors of αvβ3, such as FAK, ERK1/2, and Akt. The phosphorylation of all these factors were reduced by RNAi or integrin αvβ3 inhibitor. GBCAs also increased the phosphorylation of their downstream factor, Rac1/cdc42, belonging to the RhoGTPases family. Coexposure to the selective RhoGTPases inhibitors, decreased the effects of GBCAs on cell migration. These findings indicate that GBCAs exert their action via integrin αvβ3 to activate the signaling pathway, resulting in increased astrocyte migration. Thus, the findings of the study suggest that it is important to avoid the repeated use of GBCAs to prevent adverse side effects in the brain, particularly during development."

It was requested for use in contact with dry food, acidic foods and alcoholic beverages (represented by simulants E, B and C, respectively) with storage up to 6 months at ambient temperature. The migration data provided did not enable the assessment of the safety of applications intended for contact with foods represented by simulants B and C. In the migrate into simulant E, the non‐esterified N,N‐bis(2‐hydroxyethyl)stearylamine was the main constituent. Its mono‐ and di‐esters migrated to a lower extent. According to the data provided, the Panel concluded that the substance does not raise concern for genotoxicity and accumulation in humans. Based on the results of 28‐day oral toxicity study with SABOFOG F1 and on the 90‐day oral toxicity study with the read‐across substance bis(2‐hydroxyethyl)oleylamine, the Panel considered the current SML(T) of 1.2 mg/kg food provided a margin sufficiently large to accommodate the uncertainties related to the read‐across approach. Overall, the CEP Panel concluded that N,N‐bis(2‐hydroxyethyl)stearylamine, of which at least ■■■■■ is partially or fully esterified with saturated C16/C18 fatty acids is not of safety concern for the consumer when used at up to 2% (w/w) in all polymers intended for contact with foods represented by simulant E for up to 6 months at room temperature. Additionally, the migration of the sum of N,N‐bis(2‐hydroxyethyl)stearylamine and its mono‐ and di‐ester, calculated as N,N‐bis(2‐hydroxyethyl)stearylamine, should not exceed 1.2 mg/kg, i.e. the SML(T) for FCM substances 19 and 20, in which also the migration of the mono‐ and di‐ester of N,N‐bis(2‐hydroxyethyl)stearylamine should be included."

We postulate that senescence of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), multipotent cells with pro-angiogenic activities, is one of the mechanisms by which systemic inflammation exerts inhibitory effects on angiogenesis in preeclampsia. Methods MSC were isolated from abdominal fat tissue explants removed during medically indicated C-sections from women with preeclampsia (PE-MSC, n = 10) and those with normotensive pregnancies (NP-MSC, n = 12). Sections of the frozen subcutaneous adipose tissue were assessed for inflammation by staining for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1. Viability, proliferation, and migration were compared between PE-MSC vs. NP-MSC. Apoptosis and angiogenesis were assayed before and after treatment with a senolytic agent (1 μM dasatinib) using the IncuCyte S3 Live-Cell Analysis System. Similarly, staining for senescence-associated beta galactosidase (SABG) and qPCR for gene expression of senescence markers, p16 and p21, as well as senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) components, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and PAI-1, were studied before and after treatment with dasatinib and compared between PE and NP. Results After in vitro exposure to TNF-alpha, MSC demonstrated upregulation of SASP components, including interleukins-6 and -8 and MCP-1. Staining of the subcutaneous adipose tissue sections revealed a greater inflammatory response in preeclampsia, based on the higher levels of both TNF-alpha and MCP-1 compared to normotensive pregnancies (p < 0.001 and 0.024, respectively). MSC isolated from PE demonstrated a lower percentage of live MSC cells (p = 0.012), lower proliferation (p = 0.005), and higher migration (p = 0.023). At baseline, PE-MSC demonstrated a senescent phenotype, reflected by more abundant staining for SABG (p < 0.001), upregulation of senescence markers and SASP components, as well as lower angiogenic potential (p < 0.001), compared to NP-MSC. Treatment with dasatinib increased significantly the number of apoptotic PE-MSC compared to NP-MSC (0.011 vs. 0.093) and decreased the gene expression of p16 and six SASP components. The mechanistic link between senescence and impaired angiogenesis in PE was confirmed by improved angiogenic potential of PE-MSC (p < 0.001) after dasatinib treatment. Conclusions Our data suggest that MSC senescence exerts inhibitory effects on angiogenesis in preeclampsia. Senolytic agents may offer the opportunity for mechanism-based therapies."

Recent studies have shown that compounds from plants could promote cell migration and proliferation. Tracheloside, which is a plant lignan, has been found to promote the growth of HaCaT cells over 40% compared to other compounds tested based on a cell proliferation assay. An in vitro scratch assay confirmed the healing activity of tracheloside (more than 2-fold increased healing activity after 24 hours of treatment compared with the control) and revealed that this activity is better than that of allantoin (1.2-fold increased after 24 hours of treatment compared with the control), a positive control. With western blot results, wound healing with tracheloside occurred through the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Therefore, tracheloside is a good candidate to promote wound healing and could be developed as a therapeutic agent for wound treatment or used as a leading compound with higher activity."

(Fam. Menispermaceae), initiates the autophagy-mediated death of human glioblastoma cells by generating reactive oxygen species and activating the autophagy-lysosome pathway. However, its effects on the migration and invasion of human glioblastoma cells have not yet been elucidated. Therefore, human glioblastoma U87 and SF767 cells were treated with SH (0.125 and 0.25 mM) for 24 h, and cell migration and invasion were assessed using scratch wound healing, migration and invasion assays. SH promoted G0/G1 phase arrest, inhibited the migration and invasion of the two cell lines, suppressed the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) and the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/-9, triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, reversed the exogenous epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by the inflammatory microenvironment and the endogenous EMT. Additionally, NFκB p65 overexpression blocked the SH-mediated inhibitory effects on MMP-2/-9 expression and cell invasion. SH-induced autophagy was reduced in CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP) or autophagy-related 5 (ATG5)-silenced human glioblastoma cells and cells treated with 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) or 3-methyladenine (3-MA), as shown by the decreased levels of the microtubule-associated protein light chain 3B (LC3B)-II and autophagic vacuoles (AVs) stained with monodansylcadaverine (MDC), respectively. Moreover, knockdown of CHOP or ATG5 and treatment with 4-PBA or 3-MA abolished the SH-mediated inhibition of mesenchymal markers (vimentin, Snail and Slug) expression and cell invasion, respectively. Importantly, SH also regulated the above related pathways in nude mice. Based on these findings, SH inhibited cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest, and attenuated the metastasis of U87 and SF767 cells by suppressing MMP-2/-9 expression and reversing the endogenous and exogenous EMT in vitro and/or in vivo. Thus, SH might be a new potential anti-metastasis agent for the treatment of human glioblastoma."

Knowledge of demographic details such as age, geographical location and sex, will aid in the planning of training and resource allocation to effectively care for the future complex health needs of PLHIV. METHODS: An agent-based, stochastic, geographical model was developed to determine the current and future demographic of PLHIV in Australia. Data and parameters were sourced from Australia's National HIV Registry and peer reviewed literature. Processes that were simulated include progression to AIDS, mortality and internal migration. FINDINGS: The model estimates the mean age of PLHIV in Australia is increasing at a rate of 0.49 years each year. The expected proportion of PLHIV in over 55 years is estimated to increase from 25.3% in 2010 to 44.2% in 2020. Median age is lower in inner-city areas of the capital cities than in rural areas. The areas with the highest prevalence of HIV will continue to be capital cities; however, other areas will have greater percentage growth from 2010 to 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The age of the population of people living with HIV is expected to increase considerably in the future. As the population of PLHIV ages, specialist clinical training and resource provision in the aged care sector will also need to be addressed."

Then, novel flameretarded materials based on PBT and PET resin were formulated via melt blending with TAD, expandable graphite (EG), and a mixture of both. The effect of flame retardant type and TAD content on the flame behavior of PBT/PET blend was carefully investigated. TAD contributed towards higher LOI value and better UL-94 performance than EG. However, the best V-0 rating in the UL-94 test was achieved by the incorporation of TAD/EG mixture into the resin matrix. TAD/EG combination exhibited clear synergistic effect on both reducing the flaming intensity and increasing the residual char layer, as confirmed by cone calorimeter tests and TGA results. SEM images combined with XPS analysis revealed that expansion and migration of EG locked the P-containing radicals from decomposing TAD into the condensed phase, which led to the formation of compact and continuous char layers. All the results in our studies demonstrate that incorporation of TAD with a charring agent EG is an effective and promising technique to develop flame-retarded PBT/PET material, which has high potential for applications in the areas of electronic devices, household products, and automotive parts."

Although retroviruses may exhibit lymphocytic infiltration into exocrine glands, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) has been postulated to be a causative agent for SS. Transgenic mice with HTLV-1 genes showed sialadenitis resembling SS, but their phenotypic symptoms differed based on the adopted region of HTLV-1 genes. The dominance of <i>tax</i> gene differed in labial salivary glands (LSGs) of SS patients with HTLV 1-associated myelopathy (HAM) and adult T-cell leukemia. Although HTLV-1 was transmitted to salivary gland epithelial cells (SGECs) by a biofilm-like structure, no viral synapse formation was observed. After infection to SGECs derived from SS patients, adhesion molecules and migration factors were time-dependently released from infected SGECs. The frequency of the appearance of autoantibodies including anti-Ro/SS-A, La/SS-B antibodies in SS patients complicated with HAM is unknown; the observation of less frequent ectopic germinal center formation in HTLV-1-seropositive SS patients was a breakthrough. In addition, HTLV-1 infected cells inhibited B-lymphocyte activating factor or C-X-C motif chemokine 13 through direct contact with established follicular dendritic cell-like cells.

However, the CD-100 hydrogel showed moderate in vitro cytotoxicity to mammalian cell lines, with the DA-100 found to be the cytotoxic component. In order to extend the use of the hydrogel to abdominal surgeries, reformulation using a lower oxidized DA (DA-25) was pursued. The aim of the present study was to compare the antimicrobial efficacy, in vitro biocompatibility and wound healing capacity of the highly oxidized CD-100 hydrogel with the CD-25 hydrogel. Antimicrobial studies were performed against a range of clinically relevant abdominal microorganisms using the micro-broth dilution method. Biocompatibility testing using human dermal fibroblasts was assessed via a tetrazolium reduction assay (MTT) and a wound healing model. In contrast to the original DA-100 formulation, DA-25 was found to be non-cytotoxic, and showed no overall impairment of cell migration, with wound closure occurring at 72 h. However, the lower oxidation level negatively affected the antimicrobial efficacy of the hydrogel (CD-25). Although the CD-25 hydrogel’s antimicrobial efficacy and anti-fibroblast activity is decreased when compared to the original CD-100 hydrogel formulation, previous in vivo studies show that the CD-25 hydrogel remains  an effective, biocompatible barrier agent in the prevention of postoperative adhesions."

We here compared the metabolic changes in endothelial cells induced by D-4F and HDL against oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), which may be of benefit to understanding the protective mechanisms of HDL and D-4F. Functional assays, including wound healing, transwell migration, and tube formation, were used to evaluate the pro-angiogenic effects of HDL and D-4F. NMR-based metabolomic analysis was employed to explore the protective mechanisms underlying HDL and D-4F. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was performed to assess metabolic profiles, and orthogonal PLS-DA (OPLS-DA) was carried out to identify characteristic metabolites. Moreover, significantly altered metabolic pathways were also analyzed. We found that ox-LDL impaired the migration and tube formation of endothelial cells. Metabolomic analysis showed that ox-LDL triggered oxidative stress, impaired glycolysis, and enhanced glycerophospholipid metabolism. Both HDL and D-4F improved the migration and angiogenesis of endothelial cells, alleviated oxidative stress, and ameliorated disordered glycolysis impaired by ox-LDL. Strikingly, HDL partially attenuated the disturbed glycerophospholipid metabolism, whereas D-4F did not show this effect. In summary, although D-4F shared the similar protective effects with HDL on the migration and angiogenesis of endothelial cells, it could not deduce the molecular mechanisms of HDL completely. Nevertheless, D-4F possesses the potentiality to be exploited as clinically applicable agent for endothelial cell protection and cardiovascular disease treatment."

Dysregulation of the receptor for the advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) transmembrane signaling mediates inflammation, resulting in various cancers. However, the mechanism of the RAGE signaling pathway in modulating development of colorectal cancer has not been explored. In this study, an aptamer-based RAGE antagonist (Apt-RAGE) was used to inhibit interaction between RAGE and S100B, thus blocking downstream NFκB-mediated signal transduction. In vitro results showed that Apt-RAGE effectively inhibited S100B-dependent and S100B-independent RAGE/NFκB activation in colorectal HCT116 cancer cells, thus decreasing proliferation and migration of cells. Notably, expression and secretion of VEGF-A were inhibited, implying that Apt-RAGE can be used as an antiangiogenesis agent in tumor therapy. Moreover, Apt-RAGE inhibited tumor growth and microvasculature formation in colorectal tumor-bearing mice. Inhibition of angiogenesis by Apt-RAGE was positively correlated with suppression of the RAGE/NFκB/VEGF-A signaling. The findings of this study show that Apt-RAGE antagonist is a potential therapeutic agent for treatment of colorectal cancer."

Malformations in cortical development arise when neurons either fail to migrate properly from the germinal zones or fail to cease migration in the correct laminar position within the cortical plate. The Reelin signalling pathway is vital for correct neuronal positioning as loss of Reelin leads to a partially inverted cortex. The precise biological function of Reelin remains controversial and debate surrounds its role as a chemoattractant or stop signal for migrating neurons. To investigate this further we developed an in silico agent-based model of cortical layer formation. Using this model we tested four biologically plausible hypotheses for neuron motility and four biologically plausible hypotheses for the loss of neuron motility (conversion from migration). A matrix of 16 combinations of motility and conversion rules was applied against the known structure of mouse cortical layers in the wild-type cortex, the Reelin-null mutant, the Dab1-null mutant and a conditional Dab1 mutant. Using this approach, many combinations of motility and conversion mechanisms can be rejected. For example, the model does not support Reelin acting as a repelling or as a stopping signal. In contrast, the study lends very strong support to the notion that the glycoprotein Reelin acts as a chemoattractant for neurons. Furthermore, the most viable proposition for the conversion mechanism is one in which conversion is affected by a motile neuron sensing in the near vicinity neurons that have already converted. Therefore, this model helps elucidate the function of Reelin during neuronal migration and cortical development."

Methods The study was conducted using three mouse breast cancer models, 4 T1 and E0771 mouse breast cancer cells into their syngeneic hosts, and an MMTV-PyMT transgenic mouse strain was used. Prss14/ST14 knockdown cells were used to test function in tumor growth and metastasis, peptides derived from the autocatalytic loop for activation were tested as preventive metastasis vaccine, and monoclonal and humanized antibodies to the same epitope were tested as new therapeutic candidates. ELISA, immunoprecipitation, Immunofluorescent staining, and flow cytometry were used to examine antigen binding. The functions of antibodies were tested in vitro for cell migration and in vivo for tumor growth and metastasis. Results Prss14/ST14 is critically involved in the metastasis of breast cancer and poor survival rather than primary tumor growth in two mouse models. The epitopes derived from the specific autocatalytic loop region of Prss14/ST14, based on structural modeling acted as efficient preventive metastasis vaccines in mice. A new specific monoclonal antibody mAb3F3 generated against the engineered loop structure could reduce cell migration, eliminate metastasis in PyMT mice, and can detect the Prss14/ST14 protein expressed in various human cancer cells. Humanized antibody huAb3F3 maintained the specificity and reduced the migration of human breast cancer cells in vitro. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that Prss14/ST14 is an important target for modulating metastasis. Our newly developed hybridoma mAbs and humanized antibody can be further developed as new promising candidates for the use in diagnosis and in immunotherapy of human metastatic breast cancer."

The synthesized Zn-BTC@CS was characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the obtained data indicated a highly smooth surface morphology of the synthesized Zn-BTC and no morphological changes when the Zn-BTC covered the CS. In addition, the particle size diameter varied from 20 to 40 nm. XRD displayed a well-maintained Zn-BTC structure, and the crystal structure of Zn-BTC was not distorted by the composition of Zn-BTC and chitosan in the nanocomposite. Data from BET analysis revealed that the specific surface area of the Zn-BTC was reduced from 995.15 m<sup>2</sup>/g to 15.16 m<sup>2</sup>/g after coating with chitosan. The pore size distribution and pore volume of the Zn-BTC, Zn-BTC@CS were centered at 37.26 nm and at 22.5 nm, respectively. Zn-BTC@CS exhibited anticancer efficacy against lung and colon cancer cell lines. Zn-BTC@CS inhibited the proliferation of A549 and DLD-1 cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 13.2 and 19.8 µg/mL for the colon and lung cancer cell lines, respectively. Zn-BTC@CS stimulated the apoptotic process through up-regulating P53 expression and down-regulating Bcl-2 expression. Moreover, Zn-BTC@CS induced in vitro DNA fragmentation in both cancer cell lines with significantly different affinity by 66% (A549) and 20% (DLD-1) versus 52% reduction by Cisplatin. Zn-BTC@CS (IC50) exhibited anti-invasive activity and dramatically inhibited the migration of lung and colon cancer cell lines. This study provides evidence that Zn-BTC@CS targets the essential proteins involved in proliferation, metastasis, and apoptosis. Thus, Zn-BTC@CS has chemotherapeutic potential for inhibiting lung and colon cancer viability and growth."

They are synthesized endogenously in humans, though not fully compensating all body requirements. Consequently, they are considered as partially essential fatty acids. MUFA represent a healthier alternative to saturated animal fats and have several health benefits, including anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer characters. The main body of the abstract This review capitalizes on the major omega-9 pharmacological activities in context of inflammation management for its different natural forms in different dietary sources. The observed anti-inflammatory effects reported for oleic acid (OA), mead acid, and erucic acid were directed to attenuate inflammation in several physiological and pathological conditions such as wound healing and eye inflammation by altering the production of inflammatory mediators, modulating neutrophils infiltration, and altering VEGF effector pathway. OA action mechanisms as anti-tumor agent in different cancer types are compiled for the first time based on its anti- and pro-carcinogenic actions. Conclusion We conclude that several pathways are likely to explain the anti-proliferative activity of OA including suppression of migration and proliferation of breast cancer cells, as well stimulation of tumor suppressor genes. Such action mechanisms warrant for further supportive clinical and epidemiological studies to confirm the beneficial outcomes of omega-9 consumption especially over long-term intervention."

Herein, powder extracts of beetroot were subjected to silica gel, gel filtration, thin layer chromatography (TLC), and preparatory high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) for isolation of one compound, based on activity-guided purification using tumorsphere formation assays. The purified compound was identified as betavulgarin, using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry.

The study exploited excellent properties of the BNC to develop an efficient and low-cost in vitro cell migration assay. The BNC scaffold was introduced into a cell culture 24 h after the SW480 cells were seeded, and cells were allowed to enter the scaffold within the next 24–48 h. The cells were stained with different fluorophores either before or after the introduction of the scaffold in the culture. Untreated cells were observed to enter the BNC scaffold in significant numbers, form clusters and retain a high viability after 48 h. To validate the assay’s usability for drug development, the treatments of SW480 cells were performed using aspirin, an agent known to reduce the migratory potential of this cell line in culture.

Structural reorganization of a network into a bundle facilitated by actomyosin contractility is a physiologically relevant and biophysically interesting process. Nevertheless, it remains elusive how actin filaments are reoriented, buckled, and bundled as well as undergo tension buildup during the structural reorganization.

Based on this information, discovering new approaches or enhancing the available ones is required to provide better care for EC patients. In this review, we cover studies concerned with the anti-tumor effects of curcumin on EC. We focus on molecular mechanisms that are targeted by curcumin treatment in different processes of cancer development and progression, such as apoptosis, inflammation, and migration. Furthermore, we present the role of curcumin in targeting some microRNAs (miRNAs) that may play a role in EC."

A flow chart of an inference-based system for manufacturing scheduling is proposed and a prototype was designed using semantic web technologies. An adapted version of the Muth and Thompson 10 × 10 scheduling problem (MT10) was used as a case study and two manufacturing companies represented our use cases. Using Microsoft Project, levelled manufacturer operation plans were generated. Semantic rules were proposed for constraints calculation, scheduling and verification. Pellet semantic reasoner was used to apply those rules onto the case study. The results include two main findings. First, our system effectively detected conflicts when subjected to four types of disturbances. Secondly, suggestions of conflict resolutions were effective when implemented albeit they were not efficient. Consequently, our two hypotheses were accepted which gave merit for future works intended to develop scheduling as a web service. Future works will include three phases: (1) migration of our system to a graph database server, (2) a multi-agent system to automate conflict resolution and data entry, and (3) an optimisation mechanism for manufacturer prioritisation to scheduling services."

Here, we employed a <i>Salmonella</i>-based treatment to address metastasis. The potential of <i>Salmonella</i> as an anticancer agent has been extensively studied; however, the mechanism through which it affects metastasis remains unclear. This study found that the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) inducer SNAI1 was markedly reduced in <i>Salmonella</i>-treated melanoma cells, as revealed by immunoblotting. Furthermore, wound healing and transwell assays showed a reduced in vitro cell migration following <i>Salmonella</i> treatment. Transfection experiments confirmed that <i>Salmonella</i> acted against metastasis by suppressing protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, which in turn inhibited SNAI1 expression. Since it is known that metastasis is also influenced by inflammation, we partly characterized the immune infiltrates in melanoma as affected by <i>Salmonella</i> treatment. We found through tumor-macrophage co-culture that <i>Salmonella</i> treatment increased high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) secretion in tumors to coax the polarization of macrophages in favor of an M1-like phenotype, as shown by increased inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and Interleukin 1 Beta (IL-1<i>β</i>) secretion. Data from our animal study corroborated the in vitro findings, wherein the <i>Salmonella</i>-treated group obtained the lowest lung metastases, longer survival, and increased iNOS-expressing immune infiltrates."

puts its land use and transport systems under high pressure. Understanding how the country can accommodate residential growth and additional traffic in a sustainable manner is a key and difficult challenge that requires a policy relevant, flexible and responsive modelling framework. We describe the first fully-fletched land use and transport interaction framework (MOEBIUS) applied to the whole of Luxembourg. We stress its multi-scalar nature and detail the articulation of two of its main components: a dynamic demographic microsimulation at the scale of individuals and a micro-spatial scale simulation of residential choice. Conversely to traditional zone-based approaches, the framework keeps full details of households and individuals for residential and travel mode choice, making the model highly consistent with theory. In addition, results and policy constraints are implemented at a very fine resolution (20m) and can thus incorporate local effects (residential externalities, local urban design). Conversely to fully disaggregated approaches, a linkage is organized at an intermediate scale, which allows (i) to simplify the generation and spatial distribution of trips, (ii) to parallelise parts of the residential choice simulation, and (iii) to ensure a good calibration of the population and real estate market estimates. We show model outputs for different scenarios at the horizon 2030 and compare them along sustainability criteria."

However, the potential toxicity of Tub-A on oocyte maturation and asymmetric division is still unclear. Therefore, the present study was designed to examine the effect and potential regulatory role of Tub-A on the meiotic maturation of oocytes. We observed that Tub-A treatment induced an increased level of the acetylation of α-tubulin, and a failure of spindle migration and actin cap formation. Based on the spindle structure, most Tub-A treated oocytes were arrested in an MI-like or a GVBD-like stage and exhibited decondensed chromosomes in a dose dependent manner. Moreover, Tub-A treatment decreased the protein expression of mTOR, a factor responsible for spindle formation, and the expression of mDia1, an inhibitor of actin assembly, in an HDAC6 expression-dependent manner. Importantly, following Tub-A supplementation, most oocytes failed to extrude the first polar body, which indicates that these defects are closely linked to abnormal oocyte maturation. Taken together, our data demonstrates that HDAC6 is one of the essential factors for oocyte maturation and asymmetric division via the HDAC6/mTOR or mDia1 pathway in mice."

Here, we prepared oleic acid-modified mesoporous silica nanoparticles (OA-MSNs) conjugated with bovine α-lactalbumin, a lipoprotein complex resembling BAMLET formed on the surface of MSNs (MSN-BAMLET) to load the anticancer drug of docetaxel (DTX). Compared to that of OA-MSNs/DTX, the obtained MSN-BAMLET/DTX with a sustained and pH-responsive drug release behaviors exhibited good biocompatibility and enhanced cytotoxic effect against cancer cells. Moreover, the presence of lipoprotein complex in MSN-BAMLET contributed to the improved dispersion of the composite in solution and the inhibitory effect on the migration of cancer cells. Furthermore, the adsorption profiles of protein corona on the obtained nanoparticles were analyzed. It was found that the marked low amount and abundance of plasma proteins were adsorbed on the α-lactalbumin coated siliceous composite demonstrated its long circulation property. Finally, in vivo study showed that MSN-BAMLET/DTX contributed to the effective cancer ablation and the prolonged survival. Therefore, the constructed MSN-BAMLET of the mesoregular structure and peculiar tumoricidal effect provides a manipulable nanoplatform as drug nanocarrier for therapeutic applications."

However, with the sinking of computing power, user mobility brings new challenges: since it is usually unstable, services should be dynamically migrated between multiple edge servers to maintain service performance, that is, user-perceived latency. Considering that Mobile Edge Computing is a highly distributed computing environment and it is difficult to synchronize information between servers, in order to ensure the real-time performance of the migration strategy, a virtual machine migration strategy based on Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning is proposed in this paper. The method of centralized training and distributed execution is adopted, that is, the transfer action is guided by the global information during training, and only the local observation information is needed to obtain the transfer action. Compared with the centralized control method, the proposed method alleviates communication bottleneck. Compared with other distributed control methods, this method only needs local information, does not need communication between servers, and speeds up the perception of the current environment. Migration strategies can be generated faster. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy is better than the contrast strategy in terms of convergence and energy consumption."

However, the survival and life quality of NPC patients are still very poor. Thus, novel and selective anti-tumor agents are pressingly needed. Our previous study identified pectolinarigenin as a novel effective anti-tumor drug candidate for NPC. In this study, we further investigated its anti-tumor activities and explored the potential molecular mechanism. Methods: NPC C666-1 cells were cultured and treated by pectolinarigenin. Cell proliferation assay, colony formation assay, Transwell assay and wound healing assay were conducted and cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. Mitochondrial transmembrane potential and ROS were also observed. NPC subcutaneous xenograft mice model was established to evaluate the anti-tumor effect of pectolinarigenin in vivo. Results: We observed that treatment of pectolinarigenin inhibited cell viability and cell migration of NPC C666-1 cells in concentration- and time-dependent manner. Pectolinarigenin induced cell apoptosis in C666-1 cells detected by flow cytometry analysis, which was associated with the activation of mitochondrial-related apoptosis and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Pectolinarigenin also activated caspase signaling pathway. The in vivo experiment of subcutaneous xenograft mice model also indicated that the administration of pectolinarigenin could decrease the tumor growth of NPC and no severe toxicity was observed. Conclusions: Based on our findings, we conclude that pectolinarigenin could suppress the tumor growth of NPC, which verifies it as a new therapeutic agent for treating this devastating disease."

The present study investigates the anti-angiogenic potential of Panduratin A (PA), a natural chalcone isolated from Boesenbergia rotunda by using both in vitro and in vivo assays.<h4>Methodology/principal findings</h4>PA exerted selective cytotoxicity on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with IC(50) value of 6.91 ± 0.85 µM when compared to human normal fibroblast and normal liver epithelial cells. Assessment of the growth kinetics by cell impedance-based Real-Time Cell Analyzer showed that PA induced both cytotoxic and cytostatic effects on HUVECs, depending on the concentration used. Results also showed that PA suppressed VEGF-induced survival and proliferation of HUVECs. Furthermore, endothelial cell migration, invasion, and morphogenesis or tube formation demonstrated significant time- and dose-dependent inhibition by PA. PA also suppressed matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) secretion and attenuated its activation to intermediate and active MMP-2. In addition, PA suppressed F-actin stress fiber formation to prevent migration of the endothelial cells. More importantly, anti-angiogenic potential of PA was also evidenced in two in vivo models. PA inhibited neo-vessels formation in murine Matrigel plugs, and angiogenesis in zebrafish embryos.<h4>Conclusions/significance</h4>Taken together, our study demonstrated the distinctive anti-angiogenic properties of PA, both in vitro and in vivo. This report thus reveals another biological activity of PA in addition to its reported anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities, suggestive of PA's potential for development as an anti-angiogenic agent for cancer therapy."

It is therefore pressing to develop effective strategies to prevent and suppress tumor metastasis in its early stages. Heparanase overexpression is significantly associated with increased malignancy and metastasis. Here, we develop a novel heparanase degradable heparin-based microcarrier, HBMA, for specific staining, targeting, and inhibiting tumor cells with high metastatic potential. HBMA is fabricated through self-assembling of three components, positively charged fluorescent gold nanoclusters (KG-AuNCs), heparin polymers (HP), and antisense miRNA-21 oligonucleotides (AM-21), with each component playing multiple roles. Results of confocal microscopy and flow cytometry show that this agent has an excellent capability to label metastatic tumor cells with high selectivity. On the therapeutic side, the results of cell viability assay, wound healing assay, and plate colony formation assay verify that HBMA induces a significant inhibition effect towards the proliferation and migration of the selectively target tumor cells. The heparanase responsive AM-21 delivery, the specific staining, and the efficient tumor cell activity suppression highlight HBMA as a promising cancer theranostic agent to prevent tumor metastasis."

The parasite is distributed over a vast area in northern Eurasia and North America, but the impact of AE on human health is highly uneven between different regions. One hypothetical reason for this difference in virulence may be the genetic structure of E. multilocularis which—based on mitochondrial sequences and EmsB microsatellite profiles—forms four distinct clades. These clades correspond approximately to their continents of origin: Asia, Europe, and North America, with a fourth clade apparently restricted to Mongolia and neighboring regions, even though this clade has not yet been described by EmsB genotyping. However, there are various records of genetic variants from the “wrong” region, e.g., “European” haplotypes in Western Canada, which may be the result of introduction or natural migration of host animals. One such example, prompting this study, is the recent record of an “Asian” mitochondrial haplotype in worms from foxes in Poland. At the time, this could not be confirmed by EmsB microsatellite analysis, a method that has proven to possess greater discriminatory power with the E. multilocularis nuclear genome than sequencing of mitochondrial markers. Therefore, worms collected from foxes in Poland were examined both by EmsB analysis and sequencing of the full mitochondrial cox1 gene in order to allocate the samples to the European or Asian cluster. Based on EmsB analyses of 349 worms from 97 Polish red foxes, 92% of the worms clearly showed “European-type” EmsB profiles, but 27 worms (8%) from seven foxes showed profiles that clustered with samples of Asian origin. According to cox1 sequences, a total of 18 worms from 8 foxes belonged to the Asian cluster of haplotypes. The two methods did not fully agree: only 13 worms from three foxes belonged to Asian clusters by both EmsB and cox1, whereas 18 worms from nine foxes belonged to different clusters, according to each marker. Cross-fertilization between worms of Asian origin and those from the European Polish population may explain these conflicting results. The presence of clearly Asian elements in the Polish E. multilocularis population could be the result of introduction of E. multilocularis with host animals (e.g., domestic dogs), or the migration of foxes. In the absence of genetic data from eastern European countries, especially those bordering Poland, it cannot be concluded whether this Asian admixture is typical for a larger area toward central/eastern Europe, or the Polish parasite population is the western extreme of a gradient where both European and Asian elements mingle. Further studies are needed on this subject, preferably using both mitochondrial sequencing and EmsB microsatellite analysis."

Kinetic and thermodynamic models were developed, based on the interaction of the substrate (VO2+) with the extractive agent T and the diffusion of the formed entity (TS) through the membrane. The experimental results verify the models, and to determine, macroscopic parameters, permeabilities (P) and initial fluxes (J0), and microscopic parameters, association constants (Kass) and apparent diffusion coefficients (D⁎) related to formed entities (TS) and their diffusion through the membrane organic phase. The experimental results indicate that the mechanism on the migration of the VO2+ ions through the membrane organic phase is based on the successive jumps of substrate, from one site to another of the extractive agent. To explain these results and understand the mechanism, we studied influence of temperature factor, and we determined activation parameters (Ea, ΔH≠, and ΔS≠). The results show that this extraction phenomenon is governed by a structural term. Therefore, the membrane performance changes according to nature and structure of the association site presented by each of extractive agents."

This study tried to systematically explore the potential anti-cancer functions of Baohuoside-1 in Hepatocellular Carcinoma and study related molecular mechanism. Moreover, as a potential candidate anti-cancer agent, Baohuoside-1 has relatively low toxic side effect.Methods: The anti-cancer function including proliferation, invasion and migration of Baohuoside-1 in liver cancer was systematically assessed via colony formation, transwell assay and migration assay. Moreover, the anti-cancer functions of Baohuoside-1 was confirmed based on the nude mouse transplantation tumor experiment.

The antidiabetic agent metformin has shown its ability to inhibit tumor angiogenesis in metastatic breast cancer models. However, it remains unclear if or how metformin remodels the abnormal vasculature of metastatic breast cancer, while inhibiting angiogenesis. Methods Metastatic breast cancer models were constructed to compare microvessel density (MVD), vascular maturity and function, lung metastasis and chemosensitivity in metformin-treated or untreated mice. Protein array assay and transcriptome sequencing were performed for genetic screening. Lentiviral shRNA-PDGF-B transfection was used for observing the contribution of PDGF-B knockdown to metformin’s vascular effects. Results Metastatic breast cancers were characterized by an excessively angiogenic, immature and morphologically abnormal vasculature. Compared to control, metformin significantly reduced MVD, leakage and hypoxia, and increased vascular mural cells coverage and perfusion, namely, “vessel normalization”. Metformin at human blood concentrations had no direct effect on the migration and proliferation of cancer cells. Based on that, reduced lung metastasis of the primary tumor and improved chemosensitization by metformin were assumed to be mediated via metformin’s vascular effects. Further results of genetic screening and in vivo experiments showed that the downregulation of platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF-B) greatly contributed to the metformin-induced vessel normalization. Conclusions These findings provide pre-clinical evidences for the vascular mechanism of metformin-induced metastasis inhibition and the chemosensitization of metastatic breast cancers."

A major challenge is to develop innovative therapy in order to treat breast cancer subtypes resistant to current treatment. In the present study, we examined the effects of two Troglitazone derivatives Δ2-TGZ and AB186. Previous studies showed that both compounds induce apoptosis, nevertheless AB186 was a more potent agent. The kinetic of cellular events was investigated by real-time cell analysis system (RTCA) in MCF-7 (hormone dependent) and MDA-MB-231 (triple negative) breast cancer (TNBC) cells, followed by cell morphology analysis by immuno-localization. Both compounds induced a rapid modification of both impedance-based signals and cellular morphology. This process was associated with an inhibition of cell migration measured by wound healing and transwell assays in TNBC MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells. In order to identify cytoplasmic targets of AB186, we performed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and pull-down analyses. Subsequently, 6 cytoskeleton components were identified as potential targets. We further validated α-tubulin as one of the direct targets of AB186. In conclusion, our results suggested that AB186 could be promising to develop novel therapeutic strategies to treat aggressive forms of breast cancer such as TNBC."

In angiogenesis new blood vessels, headed by a migrating tip cell, sprout from pre-existing vessels in response to signals, e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Tip cells meet and fuse (anastomosis) to form blood-flow supporting loops. Tip cell selection is achieved by Dll4-Notch mediated lateral inhibition resulting, under normal conditions, in an interleaved arrangement of tip and non-migrating stalk cells. Previously, we showed that the increased VEGF levels found in many diseases can cause the delayed negative feedback of lateral inhibition to produce abnormal oscillations of tip/stalk cell fates. Here we describe the development and implementation of a novel physics-based hierarchical agent model, tightly coupled to in vivo data, to explore the system dynamics as perpetual lateral inhibition combines with tip cell migration and fusion. We explore the tipping point between normal and abnormal sprouting as VEGF increases. A novel filopodia-adhesion driven migration mechanism is presented and validated against in vivo data. Due to the unique feature of ongoing lateral inhibition, 'stabilised' tip/stalk cell patterns show sensitivity to the formation of new cell-cell junctions during fusion: we predict cell fates can reverse. The fusing tip cells become inhibited and neighbouring stalk cells flip fate, recursively providing new tip cells. Junction size emerges as a key factor in establishing a stable tip/stalk pattern. Cell-cell junctions elongate as tip cells migrate, which is shown to provide positive feedback to lateral inhibition, causing it to be more susceptible to pathological oscillations. Importantly, down-regulation of the migratory pathway alone is shown to be sufficient to rescue the sprouting system from oscillation and restore stability. Thus we suggest the use of migration inhibitors as therapeutic agents for vascular normalisation in cancer."

Investigators have applied various computational approaches to understand the impact the internal dynamics of such devices has on overall cell growth, but such models cannot provide a comprehensive perspective regarding the system dynamics, due to limitations inherent to the underlying approaches. In this study, a novel multi-paradigm modeling platform capable of simulating the dynamic bidirectional relationship between cells and their microenvironment is presented. Designing the modeling platform entailed combining and coupling fully an agent-based modeling platform with a transport phenomena computational modeling framework. To demonstrate capability, the platform was used to study the impact of bioreactor parameters on the overall cell population behavior and vice versa. In order to achieve this, virtual bioreactors were constructed and seeded. The virtual cells, guided by a set of rules involving the simulated mass transport inside the bioreactor, as well as cell-related probabilistic parameters, were capable of displaying an array of behaviors such as proliferation, migration, chemotaxis and apoptosis. In this way the platform was shown to capture not only the impact of bioreactor transport processes on cellular behavior but also the influence that cellular activity wields on that very same local mass transport, thereby influencing overall cell growth. The platform was validated by simulating cellular chemotaxis in a virtual direct visualization chamber and comparing the simulation with its experimental analogue. The results presented in this paper are in agreement with published models of similar flavor. The modeling platform can be used as a concept selection tool to optimize bioreactor design specifications."

Design thinking has been successfully deployed as an agent for social change. In this paper we take a trans-disciplinary approach to social design in remote villages of Uttarakhand, India. Lack of employment opportunities and tough sustenance in the mountainous regions of India has led to mass migration and ghost villages. Recent interventions at the micro level, born from a participatory approach rather than the top down structure of government development schemes, have been seen to be more effective in tackling this complex socio-economic issue. Community based participatory research has been deployed previously in areas like public health and primary education successfully. With this paper we reflect on the viability of using it to identify areas of effective design intervention, not just to address current issues faced by the residents of remote villages in the Himalayas but also to encourage future social entrepreneurs. We worked in a group of Himalayan villages in collaboration with local government agents as part of a month long design education module. Design students and development professionals teamed up with residents, using methods like transect walks, socio-cultural mapping of health, water and sanitation, education, leadership, mobility, skill and vulnerability and co-design activities. Analysis led to a deeper understanding of social structure, education, resource equity, power dynamics, flow of information, drudgery, vulnerability and potential areas for social entrepreneurs.

This paper classify the networked radar-based multi-objective task planning as a combinatorial optimization problem with constraints and abstract a distributed multi-agent system (MAS) model from a networked radar system. A node-selection algorithm was designed based on a greedy policy to narrow down solution space for subsequent networked radar task planning, reduce the amount of calculation, and improve the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, focusing on NSGA-II, the proposed algorithm was modified using self-adaptive operators and reinforcement learning. A dual-population strategy was introduced to allow exchanges of multiple individuals between populations during migration, and the number of individuals for the exchange was obtained through reinforcement learning. In this paper, five algorithms are compared and analyzed. In addition, statistical analyses are conducted from four perspectives: the average evaluation value of energy consumption and bandwidth in the Pareto front solutions, the time consumption of the algorithm, and the diversity of the population. The results indicate that among those algorithms, the reinforcement-learning-based RNSGA-II algorithm can produce the best outcomes for networked radar task planning."

Further, the model allows prediction-based simulation of cell and microvascular behavior. Like a single cell, each agent is fully realized within the model and interactions are governed in part by machine learning methods. This multiscale computational model was developed and incorporated input information from in vivo microscale computed tomography (microCT) images acquired from breast cancer-bearing mice. It was found that as the difference between expansion of the cancer cell population and microvascular network increases, cells undergo proliferation and migration with a greater probability compared to other phenotypes. Overall, multiscale computational model agreed with both theoretical expectations and experimental findings (microCT images) not used during model training."

Objective: To demonstrate the presence of RVC in Indian swine population and characterization of its selected structural (VP6) and non-structural (NSP4 and NSP5) genes. Methods: A total of 108 diarrheic samples from different regions of India were used. Isolated RNA was loaded onto polyacrylamide gel to screen for the presence of RVs through the identification of specific electrophoretic genomic migration pattern. To characterize the RVC strains, VP6 gene and NSP4 and NSP5 genes were amplified, sequenced and analyzed. Results: Based on VP6 gene specific diagnostic RT-PCR, the presence of RVC was confirmed in 12.0% (13/108) piglet fecal specimens. The nucleotide sequence analysis of VP6 gene, encoding inner capsid protein, from selected porcine RVC (PoRVC) strains revealed more than 93% homologies to human RVC strains (HuRVC) of Eurasian origin. These strains were distant from hitherto reported PoRVCs and clustered with HuRVCs, owning I2 genotype. However, the two non-structural genes, i.e. NSP4 and NSP5, of these strains were found to be of swine type, signifying a re-assortment event that has occurred in the Indian swine population. Conclusion: The findings indicate the presence of human-like RVC in Indian pigs and division of RVC clade with I2 genotype into further sub-clades. To the best of our knowledge, this appears to be the first report of RVC in Indian swine population. Incidence of human-like RVC VP6 gene in swine supports its subsequent zoonotic prospective."

RPCs must achieve appropriate spatial and functional positioning in host retina, collectively, to restore vision, whereas movement of clustered cells differs substantially from the single cell migration studied in classical chemotaxis models. Defining how RPCs interact with each other, neighboring cell types and surrounding extracellular matrixes are critical to our understanding of retinogenesis and the development of effective, cell-based approaches to retinal replacement. The current article describes a new bio-engineering approach to investigate the migratory responses of innate collections of RPCs upon extracellular substrates by combining microfluidics with the well-established invertebrate model of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Experiments utilized microfluidics to investigate how the composition, size, and adhesion of RPC clusters on defined extracellular substrates affected migration to exogenous chemotactic signaling. Results demonstrated that retinal cluster size and composition influenced RPC clustering upon extracellular substrates of concanavalin (Con-A), Laminin (LM), and poly-L-lysine (PLL), and that RPC cluster size greatly altered collective migratory responses to signaling from Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF), a primary chemotactic agent in <i>Drosophila</i>. These results highlight the significance of examining collective cell-biomaterial interactions on bio-substrates of emerging biomaterials to aid directional migration of transplanted cells. Our approach further introduces the benefits of pairing genetically controlled models with experimentally controlled microenvironments to advance cell replacement therapies."

Transforming growth factor-β-inducible gene-h3 (βig-h3), which consists of four fas-1 domains and an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif, intensifies inflammatory processes by facilitating adhesion and migration of fibroblast-like synoviocyte in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The aim of this study was to investigate whether a MMP-2-cleavable peptide complex consisting of a fas-1 domain and an RGD peptide blocks the interaction between βig-h3 and resident cells and leads to the amelioration of inflammatory arthritis.We designed βig-h3-derivatives, including the fourth fas-1 domain truncated for H1 and H2 sequences of mouse (MFK00) and MMP-2-cleavable peptide complex (MFK902). MMP-2 selectivity was examined by treatment with a series of proteases. MFK902 efficacy was determined by the adhesion and migration assay with NIH3T3 cells in vitro and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model using male DBA/1J mice in vivo. The mice were treated intraperitoneally with MFK902 at different dosages.MFK902 was specifically cleaved by active MMP-2 in a concentration-dependent manner, and βig-h3-mediated adhesion and migration were more effectively inhibited by MFK902, compared with RGD or MFK00 peptides. The arthritis activity of murine CIA, measured by clinical arthritis index and incidence of arthritic paws, was significantly ameliorated after treatment with all dosages of MFK902 (1, 10, and 30 mg/kg). MFK902 ameliorated histopathologic deterioration and reduced the expression of inflammatory mediators simultaneously with improvement of clinical features. In addition, a favorable safety profile of MFK902 was demonstrated in vivo.The present study revealed that MMP-2-cleavable peptide complex based on βig-h3 structure is a potent and safe therapeutic agent for chronic inflammatory arthritis, thus providing reliable evidence for a MMP-2-cleavable mechanism as a tissue-targeted strategy for treatment of RA."

Inhibiting constitutive STAT3 signaling represents a promising molecular target for therapeutic approach. Using structure-based design, we developed a non-peptide cell-permeable, small molecule, termed as XZH-5, which targeted STAT3 phosphorylation. XZH-5 was found to inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation (Tyr705) and induce apoptosis in human breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines expressing elevated levels of phosphorylated STAT3. XZH-5 could also inhibit interleukin-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in cancer cell lines expressing low phosphorylated STAT3. Inhibition of STAT3 signaling by XZH-5 was confirmed by the down-regulation of downstream targets of STAT3, such as Cyclin D1, Bcl-2, and Survivin at mRNA level. In addition, XZH-5 inhibited colony formation, cell migration, and enhanced the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs when combined with Doxorubicin or Gemcitabine.

Our previous studies revealed that Rictor deletion, to disrupt mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2), over longer periods result in a paradoxical rise in platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) expression in PASMCs. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of combination therapy targeting both mTOR signaling with PDGFR inhibition to attenuate the development and progression of PAH.Methods and Results: Immunoblotting analyses revealed that short-term exposure to rapamycin (6h) significantly reduced phosphorylation of p70S6K (mTORC1-specific) in hPASMCs but had no effect on the phosphorylation of AKT (p-AKT S473, considered mTORC2-specific). In contrast, longer rapamycin exposure (&gt;24 h), resulted in differential AKT (T308) and AKT (S473) phosphorylation with increases in phosphorylation of AKT at T308 and decreased phosphorylation at S473. Phosphorylation of both PDGFRα and PDGFRβ was increased in hPASMCs after treatment with rapamycin for 48 and 72 h. Based on co-immunoprecipitation studies, longer exposure to rapamycin (24–72 h) significantly inhibited the binding of mTOR to Rictor, mechanistically suggesting mTORC2 inhibition by rapamycin. Combined exposure of rapamycin with the PDGFR inhibitor, imatinib significantly reduced the proliferation and migration of hPASMCs compared to either agent alone. Pre-clinical studies validated increased therapeutic efficacy of rapamycin combined with imatinib in attenuating PAH over either drug alone. Specifically, combination therapy further attenuated the development of monocrotaline (MCT)- or Hypoxia/Sugen-induced pulmonary hypertension (PH) in rats as demonstrated by further reductions in the Fulton index, right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), pulmonary vascular wall thickness and vessel muscularization, and decreased proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) staining in PASMCs.Conclusion: Prolonged rapamycin treatment activates PDGFR signaling, in part, via mTORC2 inhibition. Combination therapy with rapamycin and imatinib may be a more effective strategy for the treatment of PAH."

At the higher layer, a decision-making distributed migration system embeds the rules written in a knowledge-based system (KBS). The rules are written and decisions are made at one component, which can be migrated by the underlying distributed system. This eventually results in intelligent migration of the decisions and robot survival, irrespective of a particular physical component failure. Moreover, a robot does not need an exclusive control system for each component. The implementation is a two-step process. Initially, component-specific facts are identified and mapped to suit to respective components and to write rules and explore different gestures and behaviour of the robot. The second step is the embedding of these rules within the distributed or agent-based system and allowing the decisions to float around the system. The Jess (Java Expert System Shell) expert system is used as the knowledge-based tool and different gestures are generated to realize the proposed method."

How cell cycle progression affects migration, and vice versa, remains largely unknown. We address these questions by combining in silico modelling and in vivo experimentation in the zebrafish trunk neural crest (TNC). TNC migrate collectively, forming chains with a leader cell directing the movement of trailing followers. We show that the acquisition of migratory identity is autonomously controlled by Notch signalling in TNC. High Notch activity defines leaders, while low Notch determines followers. Moreover, cell cycle progression is required for TNC migration and is regulated by Notch. Cells with low Notch activity stay longer in G1 and become followers, while leaders with high Notch activity quickly undergo G1/S transition and remain in S-phase longer. In conclusion, TNC migratory identities are defined through the interaction of Notch signalling and cell cycle progression."

Among the most promising approaches is the direct modulation of the function of short non-coding RNAs, particularly miRNAs. These molecules are propitious targets for anticancer therapy, since they perform key regulatory roles in a variety of signaling cascades related to cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion. The development of pathological states is often associated with deregulation of miRNA expression. The present review describes in detail the strategies aimed at modulating miRNA activity that invoke antisense oligonucleotide construction, such as small RNA zippers, miRNases (miRNA-targeted artificial ribonucleases), miRNA sponges, miRNA masks, anti-miRNA oligonucleotides, and synthetic miRNA mimics. The broad impact of developed miRNA-based therapeutics on the various events of tumorigenesis is also discussed. Above all, the focus of this review is to evaluate the results of the combined application of different miRNA-based agents and chemotherapeutic drugs for the inhibition of tumor development. Many studies indicate a considerable increase in the efficacy of anticancer therapy as a result of additive or synergistic effects of simultaneously applied therapies. Different drug combinations, such as a cocktail of antisense oligonucleotides or multipotent miRNA sponges directed at several oncogenic microRNAs belonging to the same/different miRNA families, a mixture of anti-miRNA oligonucleotides and cytostatic drugs, and a combination of synthetic miRNA mimics, have a more complex and profound effect on the various events of tumorigenesis as compared with treatment with a single miRNA-based agent or chemotherapeutic drug. These data provide strong evidence that the simultaneous application of several distinct strategies aimed at suppressing different cellular processes linked to tumorigenesis is a promising approach for cancer therapy."

However, the survival, migration and therapeutic efficacy of EPCs after transplantation need to be better understood for further cell therapy. Purpose: This study investigated the migration effect of EPCs labeled with a multimodal imaging agent in a murine ischemic hindlimb model, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and optical imaging after transplantation. Methods: EPCs derived from mouse bone marrow were labeled with a multimodal imaging agent and were administered through intracardiac delivery to mice with ischemic hindlimbs. The injected EPCs and their migration effect were observed via MRI and optical imaging in vivo, and then compared to a reference standard based on histological data. The quantification of gadolinium in tissue samples was done using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Results: Using in vivo MRI and optical imaging, the labeled EPCs were observed to migrate to ischemic muscle on days 3&ndash;5 after injection, while ex vivo, the EPCs were observed in the capillary vessels of the injured tissue. There were significant linear correlations between the Gd contents measured using ICP-MS in samples from the ischemic hindlimbs and livers and T1 relaxation times calculated using MRI, as well as the average fluorescence signal intensities recorded in optical images (T1 relaxation time: r=0.491; average signal from optical imaging: r=0.704, P&lt;0.01).

The bio-targeted therapy is a prevailing method in the treatment of melanoma; however, the accompanying drug resistance is inevitable. SH2 superbinder, a triple-mutant of the Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain, shows potent antitumor ability by replacing natural SH2-containing proteins and blocking multiple pY-based signaling pathways. Polyarginine (Arg)9, a powerful vector for intracellular delivery of large molecules, could transport therapeutic agents across cell membrane. The purpose of this study is to construct (Arg)9-SH2 superbinder and investigate its effects on melanoma cells, expecting to provide potential new approaches for anti-cancer therapy and overcoming the unavoidable drug resistance of single-targeted antitumor agents. Methods (Arg)9 and SH2 superbinder were fused to form (Arg)9-SH2 superbinder via genetic engineering. Pull down assay was performed to identify that (Arg)9-SH2 superbinder could capture a wide variety of pY proteins. Immunofluorescence was used to detect the efficiency of (Arg)9-SH2 superbinder entering cells. The proliferation ability was assessed by MTT and colony formation assay. In addition, wound healing and transwell assay were performed to evaluate migration of B16F10, A375 and A375/DDP cells. Moreover, apoptosis caused by (Arg)9-SH2 superbinder was analyzed by flow cytometry-based Annexin V/PI. Furthermore, western blot revealed that (Arg)9-SH2 superbinder influenced some pY-related signaling pathways. Finally, B16F10 xenograft model was established to confirm whether (Arg)9-SH2 superbinder could restrain the growth of tumor. Results Our data showed that (Arg)9-SH2 superbinder had the ability to enter melanoma cells effectively and displayed strong affinities for various pY proteins. Furthermore, (Arg)9-SH2 superbinder could repress proliferation, migration and induce apoptosis of melanoma cells by regulating PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK and JAK/STAT signaling pathways.

Genome-wide analysis in the human prostate cancer cell line DU-145 identified primary downregulated targets of DZ-50, including genes involved in focal adhesion integrity (fibronectin, integrin-α6 and talin), tight junction formation (claudin-11) as well as insulin growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) and the angiogenesis modulator thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1). Confocal microscopy demonstrated structural disruption of both focal adhesions and tight junctions by the downregulation of these gene targets, resulting in decreased cell survival, migration and adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) components in two androgen-independent human prostate cancer cell lines, PC-3 and DU-145. Stabilization of cell-ECM interactions by overexpression of talin-1 and/or exposing cells to a fibronectin-rich environment mitigated the effect of DZ-50.

Platelets consist of 3 types of granules: alpha granules, dense granules and lysosomes. Granule secretion releases coagulation factors, growth factors, cytokines, and a number of proteolytic enzymes. Platelets contain a number of receptors known as platelet agonists. Basic and most studied role of platelets is in hemostasis process. The aim of this paper is to point on platelet function unrelated to hemostasis. Matherials and methods: Papers on other recognized functions of platelets were searched for in biomedical journals idexed in MEDLINE form 2004 to 2016. Topic: This paper studies less known platelet functions becoming subject of interest with the development of applied science. Platelets participate in inflammation by releasing proinflammatory mediators (CD154, CD40L). Complement activation via Pselectin, platelet-generates immunomodulatory effect. CD40L accelerates releasing RANTES protein leading to intensified activation of T-lymphocytes. During embryonic development, platelets allow blood and lymph vessels separation by activating CLE-2 receptor and ligand PDPN. Platelets alleviate migration and invasiveness of tumor cells, contribute to disease progression and development of metastases. Platelets affect maturation of follicles and oocytes and have important role in embryo implantation process and placentation. Conclusion: Based on these findings, conclusion imposes platelets as not only active participants in the hemostasis process but as having significant role in inflammation, unspecified and specified body defending, tumor biology, embryonic development and in female reproductive system regulation. Numerous roles of platelets open wide range for the new drugs' operation. Their specific characteristic is the basis for the personalized Clinical pharmacology development and possibility of applying specific drug as polyindicative therapeutic agent."

Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is a medical complication of allogeneic tissue transplantation with transplanted donor T cell-mediated inflammatory response; it is characterized by a severe immune response with fibrosis in the final stage of the inflammatory process. T helper 17 cells play a critical role in the pathogenesis of GvHD. Fingolimod (FTY720), an analogue of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), is an effective immunosuppressive agent in experimental transplantation models. Methods In this study, we evaluated the effects of FTY720 as a treatment for an animal GvHD model with inflammation and fibrosis. The splenocytes, lymph nodes, blood, tissues from Syngeneic mice and GvHD-induced mice treated vehicle or FTY720 were compared using flow cytometry, hematological analyses, histologic analyses. Results FTY720 reduced clinical scores based on the following five clinical parameters: weight loss, posture, activity, fur texture, and skin integrity. FACS data showed that T lymphocyte numbers increased in mesenteric lymph nodes and decreased in splenocytes of FTY720-treated mice. Tissue analysis showed that FTY720 reduced skin, intestinal inflammation, and fibrotic markers. FTY720 dramatically decreased α-smooth muscle actin, connective tissue growth factor, and fibronectin protein levels in keloid skin fibroblasts. Conclusions Thus, FTY720 suppressed migration of pathogenic T cells to target organs, reducing inflammation. FTY720 also inhibited fibrogenesis marker expression in vitro and in vivo. Together, these results suggest that FTY720 prevents GvHD progression via immunosuppression of TH17 and simultaneously acts an anti-fibrotic agent."

Containers provide an ideal way for practical implementation of microservice-based architecture, which allows for repeatable, generic patterns that make the development of reliable, distributed applications more approachable and efficient. Orchestrators allow for shifting the accidental complexity from inside of an application into the automated cloud infrastructure. Existing container orchestrators are centralized systems that schedule containers to the cloud servers only at their startup. In this paper, we propose a swarm-like distributed cloud management system that uses live migration of containers to dynamically reassign application components to the different servers. It is based on the idea of “pheromone” robots. An additional mobile agent process is placed inside each application container to control the migration process. The number of parallel container migrations needed to reach an optimal state of the cloud is obtained using models, experiments, and simulations. We show that in the most common scenarios the proposed swarm-like algorithm performs better than existing systems, and due to its architecture it is also more scalable and resilient to container death. It also adapts to the influx of containers and addition of new servers to the cloud automatically."

This study aimed to investigate rates of migration to posttreatment after lenvatinib and to explore candidates for second-line agents in the patients with failed lenvatinib therapy. Methods: We retrospectively collected data on patients with advanced HCC who received lenvatinib as the first-line agent in 7 institutions. Results: Overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS) of 178 patients who received lenvatinib as the first-line agent were 13.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.5–15.2) and 6.7 months (95% CI, 5.6–7.8), respectively. Sixty-nine of 151 patients (45.7%) who discontinued lenvatinib moved on to posttreatment. The migration rates from lenvatinib to the second-line agent and from the second-line agent to the third-line agent were 41.7 and 44.4%, respectively. Based on multivariate analysis, response to lenvatinib (complete or partial response according to modified RECIST) and discontinuation of lenvatinib due to radiological progression, as well as male were associated with a significantly higher probability of migration to posttreatment after lenvatinib. On the other hand, alpha-fetoprotein levels of 400 ng/mL or higher was correlated with a significantly lower probability of migration to posttreatment after lenvatinib. Of 63 patients who received second-line systemic therapy, 53 (84.2%) were administered sorafenib. PFS, objective response rate (ORR), and disease control rate (DCR) for sorafenib treatment were 1.8 months (95% CI, 0.6–3.0), 1.8%, and 20.8%, respectively. According to the Cox regression hazard model, Child-Pugh class B significantly contributed to shorter PFS. PFS, ORR, and DCR of 22 patients who received regorafenib after lenvatinib in any lines were 3.2 months (range, 1.5–4.9 months), 13.6%, and 36.3%, respectively. Similarly, PFS, ORR, and DCR of 17 patients who received regorafenib after lenvatinib in the third-line (after sorafenib) were 3.8 months (range, 1.1–6.5 months), 17.6%, and 41.2%, respectively. Conclusion: Sorafenib may not be a candidate for use as a posttreatment agent after lenvatinib, according to the results of the present study. Regorafenib has the potential to become an appropriate posttreatment agent after lenvatinib."

Pairwise combinations were tested on glass slides and mycelia were stained to confirm nuclei migration between anastomosing hyphae using fluorescence microscopy. Anastomosis only occurred between mycelium hyphae of the same isolate and biotype. Mating-type PCR-based molecular assays showed that all isolates were heterothallic. The <i>MAT1-1</i> genotype was found in isolates Pc10, Pc190, Pc280, Pc309, and the <i>MAT1-2</i> genotype in Pc60. The results showed a vegetative incompatibility among isolates, suggesting the occurrence of such interactions for their respective biotypes.

While most OvCa patients initially respond to surgical debulking and chemotherapy, 75% of patients later succumb to the disease. Thus, there is an urgent need to test novel therapeutic agents to counteract the high mortality rate associated with OvCa. In this context, we have developed and engineered Nanoceria (NCe), nanoparticles of cerium oxide, possessing anti-oxidant properties, to be used as a therapeutic agent in OvCa. We show for the first time that NCe significantly inhibited production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in A2780 cells, attenuated growth factor (SDF1, HB-EGF, VEGF(165) and HGF) mediated cell migration and invasion of SKOV3 cells, without affecting the cell proliferation. NCe treatment also inhibited VEGF(165) induced proliferation, capillary tube formation, activation of VEGFR2 and MMP2 in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC). NCe (0.1 mg/kg body weigh) treatment of A2780 ovarian cancer cells injected intra-peritoneally in nude mice showed significant reduction (p<0.002) in tumor growth accompanied by decreased tumor cell proliferation as evident from reduced tumor size and Ki67 staining. Accumulation of NCe was found in tumors isolated from treated group using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). Reduction of the tumor mass was accompanied by attenuation of angiogenesis, as observed by reduced CD31 staining and specific apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells. Collectively, these results indicate that cerium oxide based NCe is a novel nanoparticle that can potentially be used as an anti-angiogenic therapeutic agent in ovarian cancer."

Environmental, interpersonal, and transactional variables such as vegetation and water availability, conflict, ethnic tensions, and private/public land delineation influence the movements of these populations. The challenges of climate change and conflict are widely felt by nomadic pastoralists in Somalia, where resources are scarce, natural disasters are increasingly common, and protracted conflict has plagued communities for decades. Bereft of real-time data, researchers and programmatic personnel often turn to post hoc analysis to understand the interaction between climate, conflict, and migration, and design programs to address the needs of nomadic pastoralists. By designing an Agent-Based Model to simulate the movement of nomadic pastoralists based on typologically-diverse, historical data of environmental, interpersonal, and transactional variables in Somaliland and Puntland between 2008 and 2018, this study explores how pastoralists respond to changing environments. Through subsequent application of spatial analysis such as choropleth maps, kernel density mapping, and standard deviational ellipses, we characterize the resultant pastoralist population distribution in response to these variables. Outcomes demonstrate a large scale spatio-temporal trend of pastoralists migrating to the southeast of the study area with high density areas in the south of Nugaal, the northwest of Sool, and along the Ethiopian border. While minimal inter-seasonal variability is seen, multiple analyses support the consolidation of pastoralists to specifically favorable regions. Exploration of the large-scale population, climate, and conflict trends allows for cogent narratives and associative hypotheses regarding the pastoralist migration during the study period. While this model produces compelling associations between pastoralist movements and terrestrial and conflict variables, it relies heavily on assumptions and incomplete data that are not necessarily representative of realities on the ground. Given the paucity of data regarding pastoralist decision-making and migration, validation remains challenging."

Due to the positive costs-benefits ratio of including soybean meal in farmed fish diets, identifying additives with intestinal anti-inflammatory effects could contribute to solving the issues caused by this plant protein. This study evaluated the effect of incorporating lactoferrin (LF) into a soybean meal-based diet on intestinal inflammation in zebrafish. Larvae were fed with diets containing 50% soybean meal (50SBM) or 50SBM supplemented with LF to 0.5, 1, 1.5 g/kg (50SBM+LF0.5; 50SBM+LF1.0; 50SBM+LF1.5). The 50SBM+LF1.5 diet was the most efficient and larvae had a reduced number of neutrophils in the intestine compared with 50SBM larvae and an indistinguishable number compared with control larvae. Likewise, the transcription of genes involved in neutrophil migration and intestinal mucosal barrier functions (mmp9, muc2.2, and β-def-1) were increased in 50SBM larvae but were normally expressed in 50SBM+LF1.5 larvae. To determine the influence of intestinal inflammation on the general immune response, larvae were challenged with Edwardsiella tarda. Larvae with intestinal inflammation had increased mortality rate compared to control larvae. Importantly, 50SBM+LF1.5 larvae had a mortality rate lower than control larvae. These results demonstrate that LF displays a dual effect in zebrafish, acting as an intestinal anti-inflammatory agent and improving performance against bacterial infection."

This work developed an integrated process based on capture of red mud (RM) and a one-step heat-treatment process to efficiently recover PGMs from spent auto-catalysts (SAC) and reuse RM simultaneously. Firstly, the iron oxide in RM was reduced to metallic iron to capture PGMs by the reduction process, without the addition of an extra reducing agent, since SAC contained abundant organic volatiles. Then, the mixed waste of SAC and RM was melted under high temperature with additives of CaO and H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>. More than 99% of PGMs can be extracted under the optimal conditions of 40–50 wt% of RM addition, 14 wt% of H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub> addition, 0.7–0.8 of basicity, 1500 °C of temperature, and 40 min of holding time. In addition, PGM content in obtained glassy slag was less than 1 g/t. The mechanism of iron trapping PGMs was also discussed in detailed, which mainly contained two stages: migration of PGMs and separation of PGM-bearing alloy and slag phases. Besides, the obtained glassy slag was further prepared into glass-ceramic by a one-step heat-treatment process. It was found that the prepared glass-ceramic has good thermostability and an excellent stabilizing effect on heavy metals. Overall, the results indicated that the developed integrated smelting–collection process is an efficient and promising method for the reutilization of SAC and RM."

In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that propofol independently reduces migration of cancer cells and metastasis. Thus, the authors retrospectively examined the link between propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and recurrence or overall survival in patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy (MRM).MethodsA retrospective analysis of the electronic database of all patients undergoing MRM for breast cancer between January 2007 and December 2008 was undertaken. Patients received either propofol-based TIVA (propofol group) or sevoflurane-based anesthesia (sevoflurane group). We analyzed prognostic factors of breast cancer and perioperative factors and compared recurrence-free survival and overall survival between propofol and sevoflurane groups.ResultsA total of 363 MRMs were carried out during the period of the trial; 325 cases were suitable for analysis (173 cases of propofol group, and 152 cases of sevoflurane group). There were insignificant differences between the groups in age, weight, height, histopathologic results, surgical time, or postoperative treatment (chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and radiotherapy). The use of opioids during the perioperative period was greater in propofol group than in sevoflurane group. Overall survival was no difference between the two groups. Propofol group showed a lower rate of cancer recurrence (P = 0.037), with an estimated hazard ratio of 0.550 (95% CI 0.311–0.973).ConclusionsThis retrospective study provides the possibility that propofol-based TIVA for breast cancer surgery can reduce the risk of recurrence during the initial 5 years after MRM."

Constructing a monovalent one-armed antibody has been reported to be an effective way to create an inhibitory anti-c-Met antibody.Materials and methods: In the present study, a novel monovalent one-armed anti-c-Met antibody was constructed using the knobs-into-holes technology, and its inhibitory effects against HCC and the underlying mechanisms were explored.Results: The one-armed anti-c-Met antibody blocked the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-Met interaction and the subsequent signal transduction, including phosphorylation of c-Met, Grb2-associated binding protein 1(Gab-1), extracellular regulated protein kinases 1/2(Erk1/2), and Akt, also referred to as protein kinase B (PKB) in HCC cell line HepG2. Furthermore, the autocrine stimulation of HepG2 cell proliferation and HGF-induced HCC cell migration were strongly inhibited by the one-armed anti-c-Met antibody. In addition, the antibody also reduced the HGF-induced proliferation and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Treating HepG2-bearing mice with the one-armed anti-c-Met antibody significantly inhibited the tumor growth in the xenograft nude mouse model.Conclusion: The one-armed anti-c-Met antibody derived from the full-length bivalent anti-c-Met antibody might serve as a potential antitumor agent against HCC.Keywords: antitumor, c-Met, hepatocellular carcinoma, knobs into holes, monovalent antibody, targeted therapy"

Among the mediators of VSMC during atherosclerosis development, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB is a potent mitogen for VSMCs and greatly contributes to the intimal accumulation of VSMCs. <i>Glossogyne tenuifolia</i> (GT, Xiang-Ru) is a traditional antipyretic and hepatoprotective herb from Penghu Island, Taiwan. This study evaluated the inhibitory effect of GT ethanol extract (GTE) and GT water extract (GTW) on proliferative and migratory activities in PDGF-BB-induced VSMCs. The experimental results demonstrated that GTE significantly inhibited the PDGF-BB-stimulated VSMC proliferation and migration, as shown by MTT, wound healing, and Boyden chamber assays. GTE was found to have a much more potent inhibitory activity than GTW. Based on the Western blot analysis, GTE significantly blocked the PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38, and JNK, in VSMCs. In addition, GTE retarded the PDGF-BB-mediated migration through the suppression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 expression in VSMCs. Three main ingredients of GT—chlorogenic acid, luteolin-7-glucoside, and luteolin—all showed significant anti-proliferative effects on PDGF-BB-induced VSMCs.

This method, however, suffers from low sensitivity and specificty. Here, we developed a quantitative non-invasive in-vivo cell localization method using contrast enhanced multiparametric MRI and support vector machines (SVM) based post-processing. Imaging phantoms consisting of agarose with compartments containing different concentrations of cancer cells labeled with iron oxide nanoparticles were used to train and evaluate the SVM for cell localization. From the magnitude and phase data acquired with a series of T2*-weighted gradient-echo scans at different echo-times, we extracted features that are characteristic for the presence of superparamagnetic nanoparticles, in particular hyper- and hypointensities, relaxation rates, short-range phase perturbations, and perturbation dynamics. High detection quality was achieved by SVM analysis of the multiparametric feature-space. The in-vivo applicability was validated in animal studies. The SVM detected the presence of iron oxide nanoparticles in the imaging phantoms with high specificity and sensitivity with a detection limit of 30 labeled cells per mm3, corresponding to 19 μM of iron oxide. As proof-of-concept, we applied the method to follow the migration of labeled cancer cells injected in rats. The combination of iron oxide labeled cells, multiparametric MRI and a SVM based post processing provides high spatial resolution, specificity, and sensitivity, and is therefore suitable for non-invasive in-vivo cell detection and cell migration studies over prolonged time periods."

Here, we investigated whether CA IX inhibition by a highly CA IX selective agent benzenesulfonamide VD11-4-2 triggers changes in individual cell motility. We seeded breast cancer cells on an extracellular matrix-coated glass-bottomed dish and in a microfluidic device with a gradient flow of epidermal growth factor (EGF), tracked individual cell movement, calculated their migration speeds, and/or followed movement direction. Our results showed that the inhibitor VD11-4-2 decreased the speed of CA IX positive breast cancer cells by 20–26% while not affecting non-cancerous cell migration. The inhibitor suppressed the cell migration velocity increment and hindered cells from reaching their maximum speed. VD11-4-2 also reduced CA IX, expressing cell movement towards the growth factor as a chemoattractant. Such a single cell-based migration assay enabled the comprehensive investigation of the cell motility and revealed that VD11-4-2 shows the ability to suppress breast cancer cell migration at a lower concentration than previously tested CA IX inhibitors."

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have recently been identified in exosomes, and exosomal circRNAs exert important biological activities in human cancers, including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether circRNA GDP dissociation inhibitor 2 (circGDI2) was transferred by exosomes and how exosomal circGDI2 regulated OSCC cell malignant behaviors.Methods: The levels of circGDI2, miR-424-5p and suppressor of cancer cell invasion (SCAI) were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) or Western blot. Cell proliferation was evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Transwell assays were performed to detect cell migration and invasion. Measurement of glucose consumption and lactate production were conducted using a corresponding assay kit. Targeted correlations among circGDI2, miR-424-5p and SCAI were confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assays. Xenograft assays were used to observe the role of circGDI2 in tumor growth in vivo.Results: Our data indicated that circGDI2 was down-regulated in OSCC, and it could be transferred by the exosomes in OSCC cells. The up-regulation of exosomal circGDI2 weakened OSCC cell proliferation, migration, invasion and glycolysis. CircGDI2 functioned as a molecular sponge of miR-424-5p, and SCAI was a direct target of miR-424-5p. MiR-424-5p mediated the repression of exosomal circGDI2 overexpression on OSCC cell malignant behaviors, and miR-424-5p silencing mitigated OSCC cell progression by up-regulating SCAI. Moreover, exosomal circGDI2 regulated SCAI expression through sponging miR-424-5p. Additionally, the overexpression of exosomal circGDI2 inhibited tumor growth in vivo.Conclusion: The present study had led to the identification of exosomal circGDI2 that regulated OSCC cell malignant behaviors through targeting the miR-424-5p/SCAI axis, highlighting circGDI2 as a novel exosome-based cancer biomarker and therapeutic agent for OSCC treatment.Keywords: OSCC, exosome, circGDI2, miR-424-5p, SCAI"

However, the extensive application of cisplatin inevitably causes drug resistance, which is a major obstacle to cancer chemotherapy. Oridonin is a diterpenoid isolated from Rabdosia rubescens with potent anticancer activity. The aim of our study is to investigate the role of oridonin to reverse the cisplatin-resistance in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. The effect of oridonin on human AML cell proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay, cell migration and invasion were evaluated by transwell migration and invasion assays in cisplatin-resistant human AML cells. Furthermore, cell apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry. The inhibitive effect of oridonin in vivo was determined using xenografted nude mice. In addition, the expressions of MMP2 and MMP9 were detected by Western blot. There was a synergistic antitumor effect between cisplatin and oridonin on cisplatin-resistant human AML cells in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the combination of cisplatin and oridonin synergistically induced cell apoptosis. Furthermore, the combination treatment not only inhibited AML cell migration and invasion, but more significantly, decreased the expressions of MMP2 and MMP9 proteins. Our results suggest that the synergistic effect between both agents is likely to be driven by the inhibition of MMP expression and the resulting increased apoptosis."

Despite the development of a variety of therapeutic agents to treat either metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, advanced prostate cancer, or nonmetastatic/metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, the progression or spread of the disease often cannot be avoided. Additionally, the development of resistance of prostate cancer cells to available therapeutic agents is a well-known problem. Despite extensive and cost-intensive research over decades, curative therapy for metastatic prostate cancer is still not available. Therefore, additional therapeutic agents are still needed. The animal kingdom offers a valuable source of natural substances used for the treatment of a variety of diseases. Bee venom of the honeybee is a mixture of many components. It contains proteins acting as enzymes such as phospholipase A2, smaller proteins and peptides such as melittin and apamin, phospholipids, and physiologically active amines such as histamine, dopamine, and noradrenaline. Melittin has been shown to induce apoptosis in different cancer cell lines, including prostate cancer cell lines. It also influences cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and necrosis as well as motility, migration, metastasis, and invasion of tumour cells. Hence, it represents an interesting anticancer agent. In this review article, studies about the effect of bee venom components on prostate cancer cells are discussed. An electronic literature research was performed utilising PubMed in February 2021. All scientific publications, which examine this interesting subject, are discussed. Furthermore, the different types of application of these promising substances are outlined. The studies clearly indicate that bee venom or melittin exhibited anticancer effects in various prostate cancer cell lines and in xenografts. In most of the studies, a combination of bee venom or the modified melittin with another molecule was utilised in order to avoid side effects and, additionally, to target selectively the prostate cancer cells or the surrounding tissue. The studies showed that systemic side effects and unwanted damage to healthy tissue and organs could be minimised when the anticancer drug was not activated until binding to the cancer cells or the surrounding tissue. Different targets were used, such as the matrix metalloproteinase 2, hormone receptors expressed by prostate cancer cells, the extracellular domain of PSMA, and the fibroblast activation protein occurring in the stroma of prostate cancer cells. Another approach used loaded phosphate micelles, which were cleaved by the enzyme secretory phospholipase A2 produced by prostate cancer cells. In a totally different approach, targeted nanoparticles containing the melittin gene were used for prostate cancer gene therapy. By the targeted nonviral gene delivery, the gene encoding melittin was delivered to the prostate cancer cells without systemic side effects. This review of the scientific literature reveals totally different approaches using bee venom, melittin, modified melittin, or protoxin as anticancer agents. The toxic agents acted through several different mechanisms to produce their anti-prostate cancer effects. These mechanisms are not fully understood yet and more experimental studies are necessary to reveal the complete mode of action. Nevertheless, the researchers have conducted pioneering work. Based on these results, further experimental and clinical studies about melittin and modifications of this interesting agent deriving from nature are necessary and could possibly lead to a complementary treatment option for prostate cancer."

The final materials are intended for contact with foodstuffs other than fatty foods for long‐term storage at room temperature including short heating. No thermal degradation of the substance is expected under manufacturing process conditions of polyolefins. Specific migration from low‐density polyethylene (LDPE) made with 0.37% of the substance into 3% acetic acid and 10% ethanol was up to 0.68 mg/kg. Based on negative results in a bacterial mutation test and in an in vivo micronucleus test, there was no evidence of a genotoxic potential of the substance. Impurities were determined and the main ones were tested in a bacterial mutation test giving negative results. Along with the negative results from the in vivo micronucleus test on the substance containing the impurities, there was no evidence of a genotoxic potential of the impurities. Based on a 28‐day study on the substance, the Panel noted that there is sufficient margin of safety between the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) and the maximum exposure of consumers that could occur at a migration level of 5 mg/kg food, to cover uncertainties about toxic effects due to potential accumulation of slowly hydrolysed branched amide species of the substance during chronic exposure. The CEF Panel concluded that the substance is not of safety concern for consumers if it is used in the manufacture of polyolefin articles intended for contact with all foodstuffs other than fatty foods and the migration does not exceed 5 mg/kg food.

The evolution of metastasis is a puzzle because a metastatic clone is at a disadvantage in competition for space and resources with non-metastatic clones in the primary tumor. Metastatic clones waste some of their reproductive potential on emigrating cells with little chance of establishing metastases. We suggest that resource heterogeneity within primary tumors selects for cell migration, and that cell emigration is a by-product of that selection.We developed an agent-based model to simulate the evolution of neoplastic cell migration. We simulated the essential dynamics of neoangiogenesis and blood vessel occlusion that lead to resource heterogeneity in neoplasms. We observed the probability and speed of cell migration that evolves with changes in parameters that control the degree of spatial and temporal resource heterogeneity. Across a broad range of realistic parameter values, increasing degrees of spatial and temporal heterogeneity select for the evolution of increased cell migration and emigration.We showed that variability in resources within a neoplasm (e.g. oxygen and nutrients provided by angiogenesis) is sufficient to select for cells with high motility. These cells are also more likely to emigrate from the tumor, which is the first step in metastasis and the key to the puzzle of metastasis. Thus, we have identified a novel potential solution to the puzzle of metastasis."

However, the important criterion was the availability of information about the testing of the constructed model on the actual data for a specific municipality. Foreign experience of application of the agent-oriented approach to the study of socio-economic systems of the meso-level is disclosed on the example of the models of municipalities that are the most interesting and promising from our point of view: these models are models of the virtual economy of the city, the model of interrelated markets for housing and land, the models of expansion of the city area, the models of reducing the city, the model of intra-city migration, the models of interconnected development of creative industries and spatial structure of the city.

However, there is still a dearth of formal models that allow us to investigate the observed short-term dynamics of microbiomes under a unified ecological and evolutionary framework. In our previous study, we developed a computational agent-based neutral framework that simulates microbiome dynamics spanning many host generations with the added dimension of a genealogy of hosts. Although this long-term framework revealed interesting microbial diversity patterns under a simple but plausible evolutionary process and provided a platform for future elaboration of more complex systems, it does not allow us to explore microbiome dynamics within a single host generation. Methods In this paper, we developed a computational, agent-based, forward-time framework of microbiome dynamics within a single host generation. As we have done under our neutral long-term models, we incorporate neutral processes of environmental microbiome assembly and microbe acquisition from parents and environment. We also incorporate a Moran genealogical model of hosts, so that the dynamics of microbiome evolution can be studied within a single host generation. Furthermore, we allow host subpopulation structure and host migration to affect microbiome recruitment. Results We show that microbiome diversity within hosts increases monotonically with increases in environmental contribution, while microbiome diversity between hosts increases with increasing parental inheritance. Host population division and dispersal limitation under high host contribution further shaped the patterns by elevating microbiome differences between hosts and depressing microbial diversity within hosts. Microbiome diversity within the whole population showed strong temporal stability regardless of the modes of microbiome acquisition and subpopulation structures. Conclusions We present a computational framework that integrates various processes including host genealogy, microbe recruitment, and host dispersal limitation acting on the short-term dynamics of microbiomes. Our framework demonstrates that the neutral dynamics of microbiomes within a population of hosts is strongly influenced by transmission mode and shared environment."

The actin cytoskeleton undergoes significant reorganization in many different contexts, including during directed cell migration and over the course of the cell cycle, when cortical actin can transition between different configurations such as open patched meshworks, homogeneous distributions, and aligned bundles. Several types of myosin motor proteins, characterized by different kinetic parameters, have been involved in this reorganization of actin filaments. Given the limitations in studying the interactions of actin with myosin in vivo, we propose stochastic agent-based models and develop a set of data analysis measures to assess how myosin motor proteins mediate various actin organizations. In particular, we identify individual motor parameters, such as motor binding rate and step size, that generate actin networks with different levels of contractility and different patterns of myosin motor localization, which have previously been observed experimentally. In simulations where two motor populations with distinct kinetic parameters interact with the same actin network, we find that motors may act in a complementary way, by tuning the actin network organization, or in an antagonistic way, where one motor emerges as dominant. This modeling and data analysis framework also uncovers parameter regimes where spatial segregation between motor populations is achieved. By allowing for changes in kinetic rates during the actin-myosin dynamic simulations, our work suggests that certain actin-myosin organizations may require additional regulation beyond mediation by motor proteins in order to reconfigure the cytoskeleton network on experimentally-observed timescales."

This work is focused on the identification of the conditions in which tumor cells can cross, by mechanical means, the basement membrane and invade the bladder lamina propria. It is demonstrated how specific mechanical properties of the cancer cells, as their stiffness and adhesion to neighboring cells, heavily determine the probability of transition from a non-invasive to an invasive tumor. In particular, it is shown how an increased cellular adhesion of tumor cells to neighbor cells and/or extracellular fibers drives a collective migration, increasing the tumor growth rate and its invasion capacity. It is proposed that these physical characteristics should be considered as potential therapeutic targets to control the tumor growth and its progress to a more dangerous condition."

Ultimately, the public’s response to announcements of lockdowns—defined as restrictions on both local movement or long distance travel—will determine how effective these kinds of interventions are. Here, we evaluate the effects of lockdowns on human mobility and simulate how these changes may affect epidemic spread by analyzing aggregated mobility data from mobile phones. We show that in 2020 following lockdown announcements but prior to their implementation, both local and long distance movement increased in multiple locations, and urban-to-rural migration was observed around the world. To examine how these behavioral responses to lockdown policies may contribute to epidemic spread, we developed a simple agent-based spatial model. Our model shows that this increased movement has the potential to increase seeding of the epidemic in less urban areas, which could undermine the goal of the lockdown in preventing disease spread. Lockdowns play a key role in reducing contacts and controlling outbreaks, but appropriate messaging surrounding their announcement and careful evaluation of changes in mobility are needed to mitigate the possible unintended consequences."

We analyse their geographical distances moved for a new affiliation and their age when moving, this way reconstructing their geographical “career paths”. These paths are used to derive the world network of scientists’ mobility between cities and to analyse its topological properties. We further develop and calibrate an agent-based model, such that it reproduces the empirical findings both at the level of scientists and of the global network.

Recent studies revealed that CA has antiviral and anti-tumor effects. However, the effect and mechanism of CA on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) through whole transcriptome sequencing integrated analysis have not been systematically investigated. In this study, whole transcriptome sequencing was used to identify differentially expressed messenger RNAs (mRNAs), micro RNAs (miRNAs), and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were influenced by CA and screen regulatory pathways. The results showed that CA significantly inhibited proliferation, invasion, and migration, whereas it induced the apoptosis of NSCLC cells. CA inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis revealed that these differentially expressed mRNAs were potentially implicated in the CA-suppressing malignant phenotypes of NSCLC. According to the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis, a ceRNA network was constructed, including 13 mRNAs, 6 miRNAs, and 11 lncRNAs. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis of the 13 mRNAs in the ceRNA network showed that suppressors of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), BTG anti-proliferation factor 2 (BTG2), and Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) were significantly enriched in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, RNA degradation, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway related to cancer. These findings indicated that SOCS1, BTG2, and BTK play an essential role in CA against NSCLC.

Recent research demonstrated the feasibility of website fingerprinting attacks on Tor anonymous networks with only a few samples. Thus, this paper proposes a novel small-sample website fingerprinting attack method for SSH and Shadowsocks single-agent anonymity network systems, which focuses on analyzing homology relationships between website fingerprinting. Based on the latter, we design a Convolutional Neural Network-Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-BiLSTM) attack classification model that achieves 94.8% and 98.1% accuracy in classifying SSH and Shadowsocks anonymous encrypted traffic, respectively, when only 20 samples per site are available. We also highlight that the CNN-BiLSTM model has significantly better migration capabilities than traditional methods, achieving over 90% accuracy when applied on a new set of monitored sites with only five samples per site. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that CNN-BiLSTM is an efficient, flexible, and robust model for website fingerprinting attack classification."

Thus, a great need exists for new targeted therapeutic approaches to more effectively treat SHH MB in children. Imipramine blue (IB), a novel molecule with anti-tumor properties, inhibits the NADPH oxidase (NOX) family of enzymes, which are critical for SHH MB survival and treatment resistance. In this study, IB was encapsulated within a liposome to form a liposomal nanoparticle, Liposome-IB (Lipo-IB). This complex has the ability to cross the blood–brain barrier and be preferentially taken up by tumor cells within the brain. We demonstrated in vitro that Lipo-IB treatment caused a dose-dependent decrease in SHH MB cell viability and migration. Short-term administration of single agent Lipo-IB treatment of SHH MB in vivo significantly inhibited tumor growth, reduced the tumor volume, including a complete tumor response, and improved survival compared to control treated mice, without any observable toxicity. We conclude that Lipo-IB is a potential novel nanoparticle-based therapeutic for the treatment of SHH MB that warrants further preclinical safety and efficacy testing for development towards clinical investigation."

This study aimed to further explore the anti-angiogenic activity of VH02 both in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro assays include cell viability, capillary-like tube formation, MMP activity, and western blot analyses of signaling through VEGFR2 while the in vivo anti-angiogenic response were performed to evaluate the effect on vascularization in Matrigel plug applied in C57BL/6L mice. VH02 reduced angiogenesis behavior of EA.hy926 including cell viability, migration, adhesion, capillary-like tube formation, and MMP-2 activity induced by VEGF. Furthermore, VH02 regulated angiogenesis by directly inhibiting VEGFR2 on Tyr1175 signaling pathway leading to the inhibition of Akt-mediated cell survival and migration. Disruption of phosphorylation at VEGFR2-Tyr1175 by VH02 abolished FAK-Tyr397 signaling but not phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. This suggests that blockade of FAK by VH02 apparently associated with reduction of endothelial cell motility. Actin cytoskeleton rearrangement was diminished by VH02 in human endothelial cells. The anti-angiogenic effect of VH02 was confirmed in the in vivo model, revealing the reduction of vascular density in Matrigel plug after VH02 treatment. Additionally, the pericyte-like cells surrounding blood vessels in the plugs were significantly reduced as well as vascular density and p-Akt intensity. Our findings indicate that VH02 successfully inhibits VEGF-induced angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo models. The compound could be further developed as an antiangiogenesis agent for cancer therapy."

First, a plasmid encoding the antiangiogenic protein endostatin was transfected into these cells by nucleofection, confirming its expression by ELISA and its biological effect in an ex ovo chick embryo model. Second, doxorubicin-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles were introduced into the cells, which would act as vehicles for the drug being released. The effect of the drug was evaluated in a coculture in vitro model with mammary cancer cells. Third, the combination of endostatin transfection and doxorubicin-nanoparticle loading was carried out with the decidua mesenchymal stromal cells. This final cell platform was shown to retain its tumor-migration capacity in vitro, and the combined in vitro therapeutic efficacy was confirmed through a 3D spheroid coculture model using both cancer and endothelial cells.

To understand how these events dynamically shape gradients and influence ensuing cell chemotaxis, we built a multi-scale hybrid agent-based model linking gradient formation, cell responses, and receptor-level information. The CXCL12/CXCR4/CXCR7 signaling axis is highly implicated in metastasis of many cancers. We model CXCL12 gradient formation as it is impacted by CXCR4 and CXCR7, with particular focus on the three most highly expressed isoforms of CXCL12. We trained and validated our model using data from an in vitro microfluidic source-sink device. Our simulations demonstrate how isoform differences on the molecular level affect gradient formation and cell responses. We determine that ligand properties specific to CXCL12 isoforms (binding to the migration surface and to CXCR4) significantly impact migration and explain differences in in vitro chemotaxis data. We extend our model to analyze CXCL12 gradient formation in a tumor environment and find that short distance, steep gradients characteristic of the CXCL12-γ isoform are effective at driving chemotaxis. We highlight the importance of CXCL12-γ in cancer cell migration: its high effective affinity for both extracellular surface sites and CXCR4 strongly promote CXCR4+ cell migration. CXCL12-γ is also more difficult to inhibit, and we predict that co-inhibition of CXCR4 and CXCR7 is necessary to effectively hinder CXCL12-γ-induced migration. These findings support the growing importance of understanding differences in protein isoforms, and in particular their implications for cancer treatment."

The state&#8217;s salmon fisheries support recreational, subsistence, and commercial harvest with multiple billions of dollars flowing into the economy, and define the cultural identity of many Alaskans. Fishery management practices rely on historic records to set policies with two goals: to meet salmon escapement quota and to maximize salmon harvest. At the same time, rapid social and ecological changes to the sub-Arctic are already impacting salmon runs and fisheries management. Combined with the inability of fishery managers to test the outcome of proposed policy changes, an understanding of the role social and ecological drivers play in harvest and effort is required. To address the two-forked problem of understanding socio-ecological dynamics and potential policy responses to ecological and social changes, we (1) conducted stakeholder workshops to solicit key system drivers, (2) built an integrated agent based model (ABM) of the system&#8217;s socio-ecological dynamics, and (3) tested the impacts of alternative future scenarios of ecological, social, and policy changes on the system&#8217;s outcomes. We previously constructed and validated a high-fidelity, data-driven, agent-based model of the Kenai River, Alaska that simulates seasonal harvest of sockeye and Chinook salmon, the fishing activities of the personal use fishery, commercial drift, and set gillnet agents. We study the role of key stakeholder and ecological drivers, using the ABM decision support tool, and their implications for fisheries management policies. Analysis of the scenario based studies found resilience in management of commercial fisheries to changing salmon migration dynamics, a lack of adaptive capacity in recreational (personal use) dipnet users to altered sockeye salmon runs, and the possible utility of introducing management measures in the dipnet fishery to manipulate sockeye escapement levels. These findings represent the usefulness of this type of ABM in assisting fishery managers everywhere in investigating possible future outcomes of different management or ecological scenarios."

Thus, there is a constant need to develop alternative anticancer drugs. Sustainable supply is an important challenge facing marine-based drug discovery. Primmorph, a 3D cell culture system, could provide a sustainable source to produce metabolites for anticancer drugs from marine sponges. In the present work, the anticancer activity of primmorph extracts and mesohyls of Negombata magnifica, Hemimycle arabica, Crella spinulata, and Stylissa carteri sponges was evaluated. Antiproliferative activity was studied in terms of cytotoxicity, colony formation, cell cycle, and apoptosis. Migration was assessed by migration assay and matrix metalloproteinase activity. The expression of proliferation and migration-related genes was analyzed using real time PCR. Migration and proliferation activities of HepG2 cells were inhibited by treatment with primmorph extracts and mesohyls of N. magnifica, H. arabica, and C. spinulata. The mesohyl of S. carteri did not show any anticancer activity although the primmorph extract led to cell cycle arrest. Among the selected sponge species, the primmorph extract of C. spinulata was the most promising anticancer agent regarding antiproliferative and antimigratory activities. In addition, primmorph extracts have the advantage of working under well-defined and controlled conditions, which allows the easy application as a bioreactor.

The pharmacological inhibition of the miR-130 family molecules by the seed-targeting strategy with an 8-mer tiny locked nucleic acid (LNA) inhibits the growth, migration, and invasion of bladder cancer cells by repressing stress fiber formation. Here, we searched for a functionally advanced target sequence with LNA for the miR-130 family with low cytotoxicity and found LNA #9 (A(L)^i^i^A(L)^T(L)^T(L)^G(L)^5(L)^A(L)^5(L)^T(L)^G) as a candidate LNA. LNA #9 inhibited cell growth in vitro and in an in vivo orthotopic bladder cancer model. Proteome-wide tyrosine phosphorylation analysis suggested that the miR-130 family upregulates a wide range of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) signaling via the expression of phosphorylated Src (pSrc<sup>Tyr416</sup>). SILAC-based proteome analysis and a luciferase assay identified protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 1 (PTPN1), which is implicated as a negative regulator of multiple signaling pathways downstream of RTKs as a target gene of the miR-130 family. The miR-130-targeted LNA increased and decreased PTPN1 and pSrc<sup>Tyr416</sup> expressions, respectively. PTPN1 knockdown led to increased tumor properties (cell growth, invasion, and migration) and increased pSrc<sup>Tyr416</sup> expression in bladder cancer cells, suggesting that the miR-130 family upregulates multiple RTK signaling by targeting PTPN1 and subsequent Src activation in bladder cancer. Thus, our newly designed miR-130 family targeting LNA could be a promising nucleic acid therapeutic agent for bladder cancer."

Abnormal remodelling can result in vascular malformation. Such is the case in mutation of the Alk1 receptor within the mouse retina which disrupts flow-migration coupling, creating mixed populations of ECs polarised with/against flow which aggregate into arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The lack of live imaging options in vivo means that the collective EC dynamics that drive AVM and the consequences of mixed populations of polarity remain a mystery. Therefore, our goal is to present a novel agent-based model to provide theoretical insight into EC force transmission and collective dynamics during angiogenic remodelling. Force transmission between neighbouring agents consists of extrusive forces which maintain spacing and cohesive forces which maintain the collective. We performed migration simulations within uniformly polarised populations (against flow) and mixed polarity (with/against flow). Within uniformly polarised populations, extrusive forces stabilised the plexus by facilitating EC intercalation which ensures that cells remained evenly distributed. Excess cohesion disrupts intercalation, resulting in aggregations of cells and functional shunting. Excess cohesion between ECs prevents them from resolving diameter balances within the plexus, leading to prolonged flow reversals which exert a critical behaviour change within the system as they switch the direction of cell migration and traffic patterns at bifurcations. Introducing mixtures of cell polarity dramatically changed the role of extrusive forces within the system. At low extrusion, opposing ECs were able to move past each other; however, at high extrusion the pushing between cells resulted in migration speeds close to zero, forming traffic jams and disrupting migration. In our study, we produced vascular malformations and functional shunting with either excess cohesion between ECs or mixtures of cell polarity. At the centre of both these mechanisms are cell-cell adherens junctions, which are involved in flow sensing/polarity and must remodelling dynamically to allow rearrangements of cells during vascular patterning. Thus, our findings implicate junctional dysfunction as a new target in the treatment and prevention of vascular disease and AVMs."

Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) are highly metastatic and are devoid of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification. TNBCs are unresponsive to Herceptin and/or anti-estrogen therapies and too often become highly chemoresistant when exposed to standard chemotherapy. TNBCs frequently metastasize to the lung and brain. We have previously shown that TNBCs are active for oncogenic Wnt10b/β-catenin signaling and that WNT10B ligand and its downstream target HMGA2 are predictive of poorer outcomes and are strongly associated with chemoresistant TNBC metastatic disease. In search of new chemicals to target the oncogenic WNT10B/β-CATENIN/HMGA2 signaling axis, the anti-proliferative activity of the diterpene Jatrophone (JA), derived from the plant Jatropha isabelli, was tested on TNBC cells. JA interfered with the WNT TOPFLASH reporter at the level between receptor complex and β-catenin activation. JA efficacy was determined in various subtypes of TNBC conventional cell lines or in TNBC cell lines derived from TNBC PDX tumors. The differential IC50 (DCI50) responsiveness was compared among the TNBC models based on etiological-subtype and their cellular chemoresistance status. Elevated WNT10B expression also coincided with increased resistance to JA exposure in several metastatic cell lines. JA interfered with cell cycle progression, and induced loss of expression of the canonical Wnt-direct targets genes AXIN2, HMGA2, MYC, PCNA and CCND1. Mechanistically, JA reduced steady-state, non-phosphorylated (activated) β-catenin protein levels, but not total β-catenin levels. JA also caused the loss of expression of key EMT markers and significantly impaired wound healing in scratch assays, suggesting a direct role for JA inhibiting migration of TNBC cells. These results indicate that Jatrophone could be a powerful new chemotherapeutic agent against highly chemoresistant triple negative breast cancers by targeting the oncogenic Wnt10b/β-catenin signaling pathway."

Additionally, image-analysis based quantification of calbindin-D28k and Ki67 was performed in rats and dogs. The patterns of cell proliferation and apoptosis, and neural migration and innervation in the cerebellum and other brain regions of active adult neurogenesis did not differ between branaplam- and control-treated animals. Quantitative image analysis did not reveal any changes in calbindin-D28k and Ki67 expression in rats and dogs. The data show that orally administered branaplam has no impact on neurogenesis in juvenile animals. Application of selected immunohistochemical stainings in combination with quantitative image analysis on a few critical areas of postnatal CNS development offer a reliable approach to assess DNT of CNS-active drug candidates in juvenile animal toxicity studies."

If the local dynamic at the subpopulation level is extinction-prone, the system viability is maximal at intermediate connectivity where recolonization is allowed, but full synchronization that enables correlated extinction is forbidden. Here we developed and used an algorithm for agent-based simulations in order to study the persistence of a stochastic metapopulation. The effect of noise is shown to be dramatic, and the dynamics of the spatial population differs substantially from the predictions of deterministic models. This has been validated for the stochastic versions of the logistic map, the Ricker map and the Nicholson-Bailey host-parasitoid system. To analyze the possibility of extinction, previous studies were focused on the attractiveness (Lyapunov exponent) of stable solutions and the structure of their basin of attraction (dependence on initial population size). Our results suggest that these features are of secondary importance in the presence of stochasticity. Instead, optimal sustainability is achieved when decoherence is maximal. Individual-based simulations of metapopulations of different sizes, dimensions and noise types, show that the system's lifetime peaks when it displays checkerboard spatial patterns. This conclusion is supported by the results of a recently published Drosophila experiment. The checkerboard strategy provides a technique for the manipulation of migration rates (e.g., by constructing corridors) in order to affect the persistence of a metapopulation. It may be used in order to minimize the risk of extinction of an endangered species, or to maximize the efficiency of an eradication campaign."

Since GBM harbors genomic alterations in cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), targeting these structures with specific inhibitors (CDKis) is promising. Here, we describe the antitumoral potential of selective CDKi on low-passage GBM 2D- and 3D models, cultured as neurospheres (NSCs) or glioma stem-like cells (GSCs). By applying selective CDK4/6i abemaciclib and palbociclib, and the more global CDK1/2/5/9-i dinaciclib, different effects were seen. Abemaciclib and dinaciclib significantly affected viability in 2D- and 3D models with clearly visible changes in morphology. Palbociclib had weaker and cell line-specific effects. Motility and invasion were highly affected. Abemaciclib and dinaciclib additionally induced senescence. Also, mitochondrial dysfunction and generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) were seen. While autophagy was predominantly visible after abemaciclib treatment, dinaciclib evoked γ-H2AX-positive double-strand breaks that were boosted by radiation. Notably, dual administration of dinaciclib and abemaciclib yielded synergistic effects in most cases, but the simultaneous combination with standard chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide (TMZ) was antagonistic. RNA-based microarray analysis showed that gene expression was significantly altered by dinaciclib: genes involved in cell-cycle regulation (different CDKs and their cyclins, SMC3), mitosis (PLK1, TTK), transcription regulation (IRX3, MEN1), cell migration/division (BCAR1), and E3 ubiquitination ligases (RBBP6, FBXO32) were downregulated, whereas upregulation was seen in genes mediating chemotaxis (CXCL8, IL6, CCL2), and DNA-damage or stress (EGR1, ARC, GADD45A/B). In a long-term experiment, resistance development was seen in 1/5 cases treated with dinaciclib, but this could be prevented by abemaciclib. Vice versa, adding TMZ abrogated therapeutic effects of dinaciclib and growth was comparable to controls. With this comprehensive analysis, we confirm the therapeutic activity of selective CDKi in GBM. In addition to the careful selection of individual drugs, the timing of each combination partner needs to be considered to prevent resistance."

PTEN is a major negative regulator of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Most human gliomas show high levels of activated Akt, whereas less than half of these tumors carry PTEN mutations or homozygous deletions. The unique ability of mesenchymal stem cells to track down tumor cells makes them as potential therapeutic agents. Based on this capability, new therapeutic approaches have been developed using mesenchymal stem cells to cure glioblastoma. However, molecular mechanisms of interactions between glioma cells and stem cells are still unknown.<h4>Methodology/principal findings</h4>In order to study the mechanisms by which migration of glioma cells can be inhibited by the upregulation of the PTEN gene, we studied two glioma cell lines (SNB19 and U251) and two glioma xenograft cell lines (4910 and 5310) alone and in co-culture with human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCBSC). Co-cultures of glioma cells showed increased expression of PTEN as evaluated by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting assays. Upregulation of PTEN gene is correlated with the downregulation of many genes including Akt, JUN, MAPK14, PDK2, PI3K, PTK2, RAS and RAF1 as revealed by cDNA microarray analysis. These results have been confirmed by reverse-transcription based PCR analysis of PTEN and Akt genes. Upregulation of PTEN resulted in the inhibition of migration capability of glioma cells under in vitro conditions. Also, wound healing capability of glioma cells was significantly inhibited in co-culture with hUCBSC. Under in vivo conditions, intracranial tumor growth was inhibited by hUCBSC in nude mice. Further, hUCBSC upregulated PTEN and decreased the levels of XIAP and Akt, which are responsible for the inhibition of tumor growth in the mouse brain.<h4>Conclusions/significance</h4>Our studies indicated that upregulation of PTEN by hUCBSC in glioma cells and in the nude mice tumors downregulated Akt and PI3K signaling pathway molecules. This resulted in the inhibition of migration as well as wound healing property of the glioma cells. Taken together, our results suggest hUCBSC as a therapeutic agent in treating malignant gliomas."

In these cells, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the ability of self-renewal and being differentiated into different types of cells, such as cardiovascular cells. Moreover, MSCs have low immunogenicity and immunomodulatory properties, and can protect the myocardium, which are ideal qualities for cardiovascular repair. Transplanting mesenchymal stem cells has demonstrated improved outcomes for treating cardiovascular diseases in preclinical trials. However, there still are some challenges, such as their low rate of migration to the ischemic myocardium, low tissue retention, and low survival rate after the transplantation. To solve these problems, an ideal method should be developed to precisely and quantitatively monitor the viability of the transplanted cells in vivo for providing the guidance of clinical translation. Cell imaging is an ideal method, but requires a suitable contrast agent to label and track the cells.

Treatment with chemotherapy has variable response rates leading to most dogs succumbing to their disease within a year. Cannabidiol is an emerging treatment within the field of oncology. In reported in vivo studies, cannabidiol has induced apoptosis, reduced cell migration, and acted as a chemotherapy sensitizer in various human tumor types. The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of cannabidiol on canine urothelial carcinoma cell viability and apoptosis as both a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy in vitro.<h4>Results</h4>Cannabidiol reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis in canine urothelial cells as determined by crystal violet viability assay and annexin V/propidium iodide flow cytometry. Furthermore, combinations of cannabidiol with mitoxantrone and vinblastine chemotherapy yielded significantly reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis compared to single agent treatment alone. The drug interactions were deemed synergistic based on combination index calculations. Conversely, the combination of cannabidiol and carboplatin did not result in decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis compared to single agent treatment. Combination index calculations suggested an antagonistic interaction between these drugs. Finally, the combination of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug piroxicam with cannabidiol did not significantly affect cell viability, although, some cell lines demonstrated decreased cell viability when mitoxantrone was combined with piroxicam.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Cannabidiol showed promising results as a single agent or in combination with mitoxantrone and vinblastine for treatment of canine urothelial carcinoma cells.

We are interested in isolating the naturally-derived small-molecule inhibitor that could simultaneously targeting TGFβ/BMP pathways and further studying its anti-proliferative/−metastatic effects as well as the underlying mechanisms in multiple tumor models. Methods Multiple in vitro cell-based assays are used to examine the compound’s inhibitory efficacy on TNBC cell growth, stemness, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion and migration by targeting TGFβ/BMP signaling pathways. Transgenic breast cancer mouse model (MMTV-PyMT), subcutaneous xenograft and bone metastasis models are used to examine ZL170’s effects on TNBC growth and metastasis potentials in vivo. Results ZL170 dose-dependently inhibits cell proliferation, EMT, stemness, invasion and migration in vitro via specifically targeting canonical TGFβ/BMP-SMADs pathways in TNBC cells. The compound significantly hinders osteolytic bone metastasis and xenograft tumor growth without inflicting toxicity on vital organs of tumor-bearing nude mice. ZL170 strongly inhibits primary tumor growth and lung metastases in MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice. ZL170-treated tumors exhibit impaired TGFβ/BMP signaling pathways in both epithelial and stromal compartments, thereby creating a suppressive tumor microenvironment characterized by reduced extracellular matrix deposition and decreased infiltration of stromal cells. Conclusions ZL170 inhibits tumor EMT, stemness and metastasis and could be further developed as a potent anti-metastatic agent used in combination with cytotoxic drugs for treatment of TNBC and other advanced metastatic cancers."

This disease is uniformly fatal, with intratumor heterogeneity the major reason for treatment failure and recurrence. Just like the nature vs nurture debate, heterogeneity can arise from intrinsic or environmental influences. Whilst it is impossible to clinically separate observed behavior of cells from their environmental context, using a mathematical framework combined with multiscale data gives us insight into the relative roles of variation from different sources. To better understand the implications of intratumor heterogeneity on therapeutic outcomes, we created a hybrid agent-based mathematical model that captures both the overall tumor kinetics and the individual cellular behavior. We track single cells as agents, cell density on a coarser scale, and growth factor diffusion and dynamics on a finer scale over time and space. Our model parameters were fit utilizing serial MRI imaging and cell tracking data from ex vivo tissue slices acquired from a growth-factor driven glioblastoma murine model. When fitting our model to serial imaging only, there was a spectrum of equally-good parameter fits corresponding to a wide range of phenotypic behaviors. When fitting our model using imaging and cell scale data, we determined that environmental heterogeneity alone is insufficient to match the single cell data, and intrinsic heterogeneity is required to fully capture the migration behavior. The wide spectrum of in silico tumors also had a wide variety of responses to an application of an anti-proliferative treatment. Recurrent tumors were generally less proliferative than pre-treatment tumors as measured via the model simulations and validated from human GBM patient histology. Further, we found that all tumors continued to grow with an anti-migratory treatment alone, but the anti-proliferative/anti-migratory combination generally showed improvement over an anti-proliferative treatment alone. Together our results emphasize the need to better understand the underlying phenotypes and tumor heterogeneity present in a tumor when designing therapeutic regimens."

Given that high quantities of dephosphorization agent are needed to obtain low phosphorus reduced iron, a novel approach is proposed by the authors. Without prior phosphorus removal, the phosphorus was enriched in the reduced iron during a reduction process, then high-phosphorus reduced iron was refined to low phosphorus molten iron and high phosphorus dephosphorization slag to be used as a phosphate fertilizer. The influences of various parameters, including the reduction temperature, the reduction time, and the C/O molar ratio, on the reaction behavior of phosphorus during reduction process were studied. Experimental results indicate that a higher reduction temperature, a longer reduction time, or a higher C/O molar ratio was favorable for the reduction of apatite to phosphorus and the enrichment of phosphorus in reduced iron. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis demonstrated that the apatite was reduced to phosphorus and Ca2SiO4 (or Ca(Al2Si2O8)) in the presence of SiO2 and Al2O3, whilst the phosphorus enriched in reduced iron formed Fe3P. The migration behavior of phosphorus was investigated using line scanning analysis of reduction products at different reduction times. The results show that the phosphorus primarily existed in the slag phase 10 min before reduction, and a large amount of phosphorus migrated into iron phase from slag phase with a reduction time of 40 min. The phosphorus content in the iron phase only slightly changed after 50 min. The pre-dephosphorization of reduced iron was performed at 1873 K, indicating a higher basicity or FetO content of CaO-based slag was beneficial to dephosphorization of the reduced iron."

Four secondary metabolites obtained from Spongionella (Gracilin H, A, L and Tetrahydroaplysulphurin-1) were described to hit Cyp A and to block the release of inflammation mediators. Based on these results some role of Spongionella compounds on other steps of the signalling pathway mediated by this chemotactic agent can be hypothesised. In the present paper we studied the effect of these four compounds on the surface membrane CD147 receptor expression, on the extracellular levels of Cyp A and on the ability to migrate of concanavalin (Con A)-activated T lymphocytes. Similarly to a well-known immunosuppressive agent cyclosporine A (CsA), Gracilin H, A, L and tetrahydroaplysulphurin-1 were able to reduce the CD147 membrane expression and to block the release of Cyp A to the medium. Besides, by using Cyp A as chemotactic agent, T cell migration was inhibited when cells were previously incubated with Gracilin A and Gracilin L. These positive results lead us to test the in vivo effect of Gracilin H and L in a mouse ear delayed hypersensitive reaction. Thus, both compounds efficiently reduce the ear swelling as well as the inflammatory cell infiltration. These results provide more evidences for their potential therapeutic application in immune related diseases of Spongionella compounds."

However, there are few comprehensive studies on identifying gas channeling channels, the influencing factors, and the corresponding plugging EOR systems in FAORAF. The channeling channels of the injection and production wells of the Changqing Oilfield, China, under varying development schemes are identified utilizing fuzzy membership function theory in this work to obtain their primary distribution. The characteristics and influence factors of gas channeling channels are analyzed by numerical simulation using CMG. The recovery performance of each foam blocking system is evaluated by twin-tube sand pack models. As well, based on the features of reservoir fractures, a new gel-enhanced foam plugging system is developed. The results show that channeling channels chiefly develop along NE 60–70° and that foam could reduce gas channeling. Natural and artificial fractures are the principal factors causing gas channeling, followed by the injection method and gas injection rate. Under the premise of the injection and migration efficiency, the optimal gel system is a 0.1% HPAM + 0.1% organic chromium crosslinking agent. The addition of gel increases the viscosity of the liquid phase and strengthens the mechanical strength of the foam liquid film. At a permeability ratio of 12, the recovery factors of the binary plugging systems composed of microspheres, PEG, and gel combined with foam are 40.89%, 45.85%, and 53.33%, respectively.

The IAPs function as E3 ubiquitin ligases and contribute to pancreatic cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis. Although IAP-targeted therapies have been developed and shown anticancer efficacy in preclinical settings, none of them has been approved yet. Methods Transcriptome data from public datasets were used to analyze the correlation of IAPs and E2s, and the biological function of E2 UbcH5c in pancreatic cancer. A structure-based virtual screen was used to identify UbcH5c inhibitor, and surface plasmon resonance analysis and cellular thermal shift assays were employed to evaluate the binding affinity. The anticancer activities were demonstrated through in vitro and in vivo assays, while the related mechanisms were explored through transcriptomic and proteomic analyses and confirmed by western blot, immunofluorescence, and qRT-PCR. Results UbcH5c is positively correlated with the expression of IAPs in pancreatic cancer. We further found that UbcH5c is overexpressed and associated with a poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer. We identified a small-molecule UbcH5c inhibitor, termed DHPO, which directly bound to UbcH5c protein. DHPO inhibited cell viability and colony formation, induced apoptosis, and suppressed migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. The compound inhibited UbcH5c-mediated IκBα degradation and NF-κB activation, which is critical for its anticancer activity. Furthermore, DHPO suppressed the tumor growth and metastasis in two orthotopic pancreatic tumor mouse models. Conclusions These results indicated that inhibiting UbcH5c is a novel and effective strategy for treating pancreatic cancer and DHPO represents a new class of UbcH5c inhibitor and may be further developed as an anti-pancreatic cancer therapeutic agent."

Many reasons for the development of stratification have been proposed, from the need for hierarchical control over large-scale irrigation systems to the accumulation of small differences in wealth over time via inheritance processes. However, none of these explains how unequal societies came to completely displace egalitarian cultural norms over time. Our study models demographic consequences associated with the unequal distribution of resources in stratified societies. Agent-based simulation results show that in constant environments, unequal access to resources can be demographically destabilizing, resulting in the outward migration and spread of such societies even when population size is relatively small. In variable environments, stratified societies spread more and are also better able to survive resource shortages by sequestering mortality in the lower classes. The predictions of our simulation are provided modest support by a range of existing empirical studies. In short, the fact that stratified societies today vastly outnumber egalitarian societies may not be due to the transformation of egalitarian norms and structures, but may instead reflect the more rapid migration of stratified societies and consequent conquest or displacement of egalitarian societies over time."

Although some LncRNAs are overexpressed in plasma, T cell, and synovial tissues of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), there is a dearth of knowledge in what role these transcripts play in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) of these patients. Here, our studies showed that GAPLINC, a newly identified functional LncRNA in oncology, displayed a greater degree of expression in FLSs from RA than in patients with traumatic injury. GAPLINC suppression in RA-FLS cells revealed significant alterations in cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and proinflammatory cytokines production. Additionally, we performed a preliminary bioinformatics analysis of GAPLINC gene sequence in order to find its target molecules, using miRanda, PITA, RNAhybrid algorithms, Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes, and gene ontology analysis. Since the results predicted that some of microRNAs and mRNA may interact with GAPLINC, we simulated a gene co-action network model based on a competitive endogenous RNA theory. Further verification of this model demonstrated that silencing of GAPLINC increased miR-382-5p and miR-575 expression. The results of this study suggest that GAPLINC may function as a novel microRNAs sponging agent affecting the biological characteristics of RA-FLSs. Additionally, GAPLINC may also promote RA-FLS tumor-like behaviors in a miR-382-5p-dependent and miR-575-dependent manner. Based upon these findings, LncRNA GAPLINC may provide a novel valuable therapeutic target for RA patients."

The MA-based approach employs two algorithms: Single-agent Itinerary Planning (SIP) and Multi-mobile agent Itinerary Planning (MIP) for energy-efficient data gathering. The MIP was proposed to outperform the weakness of SIP by introducing distributed multi MAs to perform the data gathering task. Despite the advantages of MIP, finding the optimal number of distributed MAs and their itineraries are still regarded as critical issues. The existing MIP algorithms assume that the itinerary of the MA has to start and return back to the sink node. Moreover, each distributed MA has to carry the processing code (data aggregation code) to collect the sensory data and return back to the sink with the accumulated data. However, these assumptions have resulted in an increase in the number of MA’s migration hops, which subsequently leads to an increase in energy and time consumption. In this paper, a spawn multi-mobile agent itinerary planning (SMIP) approach is proposed to mitigate the substantial increase in cost of energy and time used in the data gathering processes. The proposed approach is based on the agent spawning such that the main MA is able to spawn other MAs with different tasks assigned from the main MA. Extensive simulation experiments have been conducted to test the performance of the proposed approach against some selected MIP algorithms. The results show that the proposed SMIP outperforms the counterpart algorithms in terms of energy consumption and task delay (time), and improves the integrated energy-delay performance."

Studies have shown that caffeine reduces the cytotoxic effects of paclitaxel and inhibits paclitaxel-induced apoptosis; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether caffeine inhibits the antitumor activity of paclitaxel via down-regulation of α-tubulin acetylation. In vitro studies, involving MTT assay, wound-healing assay, cell apoptosis assay, and western blotting analysis of A549 and HeLa cells, were performed. A549 and HeLa cell-based xenografts were established, and western blotting and immunohistochemical staining were performed for in vivo studies. The results showed that caffeine promoted the growth of cancer cells treated with paclitaxel. Additionally, caffeine enhanced migration ability, inhibited apoptosis, and decreased the acetylation of α-tubulin in paclitaxel-treated cancer cells. Furthermore, caffeine decreased the inhibitory effect of paclitaxel on tumor growth through down-regulation of α-tubulin acetylation in vivo. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that caffeine inhibits the anticancer activity of paclitaxel via down-regulation of α-tubulin acetylation, suggesting that patients receiving treatment with taxanes, such as paclitaxel, should avoid consuming caffeinated beverages or foods."

F-RUT was also observed to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and inflammatory infiltrating neutrophils in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated zebrafish and ovalbumin (OVA)/alum-challenged KLF-10-knockout mouse lungs, respectively. Furthermore, F-RUT ameliorated the respiratory function in OVA/alum-challenged BALB/c mice by maintaining the thickness of the blood-air barrier in mouse lungs.

Low molecular weight plasticizers, such as tributyl 2-acetyl citrate (TAC), cannot properly solve this issue. Herein, PHB films were obtained using a biosynthesized poly(3-hydroxyoctanoate) (PHO) and a commercially available TAC as toughening agents. The use of TAC strongly decreased the PHB thermal stability up to 200 °C due to the loss of low boiling point plasticizer, while minor weight loss was noticed at this temperature for the PHB-PHO blend. Both agents shifted the glass transition temperature of PHB to a lower temperature, the effect being more pronounced for TAC. The elongation at break of PHB increased by 700% after PHO addition and by only 185% in the case of TAC; this demonstrates an important toughening effect of the polymeric modifier.

China","How to break the vicious cycle of poverty and ecological degradation is widely concerned and discussed. In the poverty alleviation practices in China, ecological poverty alleviation (EPA) is regarded as an important way to synthesize the dual goals of poverty reduction and environmental protection and to achieve the win-win outcomes. Many Chinese researchers have fruitful research achievements on EPA yet they do not recognize that EPA is not a simple combination of various policies, but a complex system involving multiple policy instruments, governmental agencies, social forces, and agents. However, few studies abroad illustrate EPA in detail. They focus more on specific components of EPA such as payment for ecosystem services while overlooking the integral concept of EPA and practices from China. Based on field research in Guizhou Province, China, this paper proposes a framework of EPA with an effective multi-agent and co-government system, for demonstrating the concept and practice of EPA. With case analysis, we illustrate key elements in this system and their relationships, and how they play a vital role in pursuing win-win outcomes in environmental protection and poverty alleviation. The three dimensions of this EPA system have been discussed. The first is to strengthen the interaction among the agents. Many efforts should be made for establishing an efficient communication routine and a stable relationship among their interests. The second is to reinforce the connection between diverse elements in each policy subsystem, such as the systematization and coordination of the ecological industry development, the systematization of the links before, during, and after the relocation of ecological immigrants, etc. The third is to promote the interactions between the three subsystems, so that ecological enhancement, ecological compensation, and industrial development, and migration and relocation can promote each other, and ultimately promote the coordination of poverty alleviation and ecological protection in poverty-stricken areas. Thus, this paper analyzes how to establish the communication routine among the relevant agents of EPA, the interaction among the internal elements of the subsystems, and the relationship between the subsystems in series, trying to reveal the basic operating mechanism of the system."

The late stage detection, the peritoneal dissemination and the acquisition of resistance against carboplatin are the main reasons to explain this poor prognosis and strengthen the need of alternative treatments to improve the management of ovarian cancer and/or to sensitize tumors to platinum salts. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), hepatocyte growth factor receptor (Met) and cellular Src kinase (c-Src) are crucial kinases implied in ovarian tumor growth, survival, invasion and resistance to carboplatin. Their expression is increased in advanced ovarian cancers and is correlated with poor prognosis. Despite a clear potential in inhibiting these proteins in ovarian cancer, as a single agent or in combination with a carboplatin treatment, we need to target kinases in tandem because of their capacity to trigger compensatory pathways that synergize to promote drug resistance. Methods Here we target EGFR, c-Src and Met individually or in combination with carboplatin, using Gefitinib, Dasatinib and Crizotinib respectively, in a panel of carboplatin-sensitive (OVCAR-3, IGROV-1 and A2780) and carboplatin-resistant cells (SKOV-3 and EFO-21). We studied the ability of the most potent combination to induce apoptosis, regulate migration, invasion and to modulate the activation of proliferation and survival proteins. Results Crizotinib, Dasatinib and Gefitinib, alone or in combination with carboplatin, showed a cell-specific cytotoxic synergy in ovarian cancer cells. The Dasatinib plus Gefitinib combination was synergistic in OVCAR-3, SKOV-3 and, in IGROV-1 cells (high concentrations). This combination was unable to induce apoptosis but suppressed cell migration, invasion and the activation of EGFR, Erk, c-Src and Akt compared to single treatments. Conclusions Combining carboplatin with kinase inhibitors lead to synergistic interactions in a cell-specific manner. Unlike platinum-based combinations, mixing Dasatinib with Gefitinib led to cytotoxic activity, inhibition of cell migration and invasion. Thus, the Dasatinib + Gefitinib combination presents anti-tumour properties that are superior to those of platinum-based combinations, indicating that it may well represent a promising new treatment modality to be tested in the clinic."

Treatment with a combination Gem and Rapa was much more effective than that of either single agent with respect to reducing cell viability, cell invasion, cell migration<i>, </i>and vascular endothelial growth factor production in vitro. Moreover, the combination of these agents suppressed tumor growth, angiogenesis, and lung metastasis in allograft and xenograft murine models of OS with minimal adverse effects. Overall, the combination therapy prolonged the overall survival of tumor-bearing mice.

Adaptive therapy is used to maintain a tumor’s volume by exploiting the competition between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cells with minimum effective drug doses or timed drug holidays. To further understand the role of competition in the outcomes of adaptive therapy, we developed a 2D on-lattice agent-based model. Our simulations show that the superiority of the adaptive strategy over continuous therapy depends on the local competition shaped by the spatial distribution of resistant cells. Intratumor competition can also be affected by fibroblasts, which produce microenvironmental factors that promote cancer cell growth. To this end, we simulated the impact of different fibroblast distributions on treatment outcomes. As a proof of principle, we focused on five types of distribution of fibroblasts characterized by different locations, shapes, and orientations of the fibroblast region with respect to the resistant cells. Our simulation shows that the spatial architecture of fibroblasts modulates tumor progression in both continuous and adaptive therapy. Finally, as a proof of concept, we simulated the outcomes of adaptive therapy of a virtual patient with four metastatic sites composed of different spatial distributions of fibroblasts and drug-resistant cell populations. Our simulation highlights the importance of undetected metastatic lesions on adaptive therapy outcomes. Author summary Tumors are composed of different cancer cells with varying degrees of treatment resistance, which compete for a shared resource. Adaptive therapy exploits this competition. The paradigm employs patient-specific on and off treatment schedules or lower doses to permit a significant number of drug-sensitive cells to survive. The surviving sensitive cells can suppress the growth of drug-resistant cells via intratumor competition. This competition can be modulated by the spatial structure of tumors. For example, resistant cell configuration, carrying capacity, or migration rate may change local spatial competition between drug-resistant cells or between drug-sensitive and drug resistant cells. In addition, the presence of growth factors produced by stromal cells such as fibroblasts promotes the proliferation of cells, enhancing the competition. To understand the impact of forenamed factors on the outcomes of adaptive therapy, we developed a computational model, 2D on-lattice agent-based model. Our findings show that the spatial factors regulate the local competition and may hold back the benefit of adaptive therapy. Further, the impact of fibroblast depends on the respective positioning of fibroblast to the resistant cells. Finally, we simulated the outcomes of adaptive therapy on multiple metastatic lesions of mixed spatial configuration on a virtual patient. In the simulation, we highlight the importance of undetected metastatic lesions on therapy outcomes."

Thorough review was completed and data relevant to methods of diagnosis, treatment, complications, hospital readmission, and mortality were extracted from patient charts. The patients were followed for two years after diagnosis.Results: Of the 47 patients identified as having “MTS”, 32 (70%) were diagnosed formally with either magnetic resonance venography, computed tomography venography, or ultrasound. Two patients were excluded for insufficient availability of follow-up records. Mean age of the population included (N = 30) was 50.24 ± 15.33 years and 83% (N = 25) had female gender. The majority (40%) of patients were treated with anticoagulation, thrombolysis, and stent placement, and 13.3% received a combination of anticoagulation, antiplatelet agent, thrombolysis, and stent placement. Overall, we found 28 patients (93%) who underwent endovascular stenting. However, 39.3% (11/28) had stent-related complications that included stent thrombosis, stenosis, and migration. One patient underwent open heart surgery for stent retrieval. Duration of anticoagulation therapy ranged from 6 months to lifelong. Two patients (6.7%) suffered major bleeds requiring transfusion. Fourteen patients (46.6%) developed post-thrombotic syndrome. Seven (23.3%) patients required MTS-related readmission within 30 days. No mortality was noted at two-year follow-up.Conclusion: Although our study only included 30 patients, it was evident to us that there is no consensus in the management of MTS. Furthermore, endovascular stenting, which has a major role in the management of MTS, has complication rates that hover close to 40%. Further research is needed to help develop a standardized evidence-based approach in the management of MTS that ensures a decreased risk of immediate and long-term complications.Keywords: May–Thurner syndrome, treatment, complications, diagnosis, anticoagulation"

However, its expression and function in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain unclear. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore the effects of miR-32 expression on NSCLC tumorigenesis and development. Methods: Using real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), we detected miR-32 expression in NSCLC cell lines and primary tumor tissues. The association of miR-32 expression with clinicopathological factors and prognosis was also analyzed. Then, the effects of miR-32 expression on the biological behavior of NSCLC cells were investigated. Finally, the potential regulatory effect of miR-32 on SOX9 expression was confirmed.Results: miR-32 expression levels were significantly downregulated in NSCLC compared with the corresponding noncancerous lung tissues (P&lt;0.001). In addition, decreased miR-32 expression was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (P=0.002), advanced tumor/nodes/metastasis (TNM) classification stages (P&lt;0.001), and shorter overall survival (P&lt;0.001). Multivariate regression analysis corroborated that downregulated miR-32 expression was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for NSCLC patients. In vitro studies demonstrated that miR-32 overexpression reduced A549 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and promoted apoptosis. Furthermore, SOX9 was confirmed as a direct target of miR-32, using a luciferase reporter assay.Conclusion: These findings indicate that miR-32 may act as a tumor suppressor in NSCLC and could serve as a novel therapeutic agent for miR-based therapy.

However, their performance still suffers from severe ion migration, trap‐induced nonradiative recombination, and black phase instability due to lower tolerance factor and high total energy. Here, a combinational passivation strategy to suppress ion migration and reduce traps both on the surface and in the bulk of the CsPhTh3 perovskite film is developed, resulting in improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) to as high as 19.37%. The involvement of guanidinium (GA) into the CsPhTh3 perovskite bulk film and glycocyamine (GCA) passivation on the perovskite surface and grain boundary synergistically enlarge the tolerance factor and suppress the trap state density. In addition, the acetate anion as a nucleating agent significantly improves the thermodynamic stability of GA‐doped CsPbTh3 film through the slight distortion of PbI6 octahedra. The decreased nonradiative recombination loss translates to a high fill factor of 82.1% and open‐circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.17 V. Furthermore, bare CsPbTh3 perovskite solar cells without any encapsulation retain 80% of its initial PCE value after being stored for one month under ambient conditions."

However, increasing resistance to insecticides threatens to undermine these efforts. Understanding the evolution and propagation of resistance is thus imperative to mitigating loss of intervention effectiveness. Additionally, accelerated research and development of new tools that can be deployed alongside existing vector control strategies is key to eradicating malaria in the near future. Methods such as gene drives that aim to genetically modify large mosquito populations in the wild to either render them refractory to malaria or impair their reproduction may prove invaluable tools. Mathematical models of gene flow in populations, which is the transfer of genetic information from one population to another through migration, can offer invaluable insight into the behavior and potential impact of gene drives as well as the spread of insecticide resistance in the wild. Here, we present the first multi-locus, agent-based model of vector genetics that accounts for mutations and a many-to-many mapping cardinality of genotypes to phenotypes to investigate gene flow, and the propagation of gene drives in Anopheline populations. This model is embedded within a large scale individual-based model of malaria transmission representative of a high burden, high transmission setting characteristic of the Sahel. Results are presented for the selection of insecticide-resistant vectors and the spread of resistance through repeated deployment of insecticide treated nets (ITNs), in addition to scenarios where gene drives act in concert with existing vector control tools such as ITNs. The roles of seasonality, spatial distribution of vector habitat and feed sites, and existing vector control in propagating alleles that confer phenotypic traits via gene drives that result in reduced transmission are explored. The ability to model a spectrum of vector species with different genotypes and phenotypes in the context of malaria transmission allows us to test deployment strategies for existing interventions that reduce the deleterious effects of resistance and allows exploration of the impact of new tools being proposed or developed."

","Bacterial pathogens have evolved to secrete strong anti-inflammatory proteins that target the immune system. It was long speculated whether these virulence factors could serve as therapeutics in diseases in which abnormal immune activation plays a role. We adopted the secreted chemotaxis inhibitory protein of Staphylococcus aureus (CHIPS) as a model virulence factor-based therapeutic agent for diseases in which C5AR1 stimulation plays an important role. We show that the administration of CHIPS in human C5AR1 knock-in mice successfully dampens C5a-mediated neutrophil migration during immune complex-initiated inflammation. Subsequent CHIPS toxicology studies in animal models were promising. However, during a small phase I trial, healthy human volunteers showed adverse effects directly after CHIPS administration. Subjects showed clinical signs of anaphylaxis with mild leukocytopenia and increased C-reactive protein concentrations, which are possibly related to the presence of relatively high circulating anti-CHIPS antibodies and suggest an inflammatory response. Even though our data in mice show CHIPS as a potential anti-inflammatory agent, safety issues in human subjects temper the use of CHIPS in its current form as a therapeutic candidate. The use of staphylococcal proteins, or other bacterial proteins, as therapeutics or immune-modulators in humans is severely hampered by pre-existing circulating antibodies."

However, the anti-metastatic effect and molecular mechanism(s) of baicalein on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain poorly understood. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the anti-metastatic effects of baicalein and related mechanism(s) on HCC. Based on assays utilized in both HCC cell lines and in an animal model, we found that baicalein inhibited tumor cell metastasis in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, after treatment with baicalein for 24 hours, there was a decrease in the levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9 and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) expression as well as proteinase activity in hepatocellular carcinoma MHCC97H cells. Meanwhile, the expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and TIMP-2 were increased in a dose-dependent fashion. Moreover, baicalein treatment dramatically decreased the levels of the phosphorylated forms of MEK1 and ERK1/2. MEK1 overexpression partially blocked the anti-metastatic effects of baicalein. Combined treatment with an ERK inhibitor (U0126) and baicalein resulted in a synergistic reduction in MMP-2, MMP-9 and u-PA expression and an increase in TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 expression; the invasive capabilities of MHCC97H cells were also inhibited. In conclusion, baicalein inhibits tumor cell invasion and metastasis by reducing cell motility and migration via the suppression of the ERK pathway, suggesting that baicalein is a potential therapeutic agent for HCC."

According to United Nations indicators, Iran currently has a severe water crisis, because about 69% of the total annual renewable water used in the country .Also, according to statement political officials, if the water crisis Continuity, about 50 million people will be forced to migrate in Iran in the next 25 years, and the east and south of the country will be actually empty. Meanwhile, the eastern part of Isfahan is one of the areas that, despite the seriousness of the water crisis in it, has been less an issue of independent research. This research gap is that firstly, dehydration has led to unrest in the region at least in two periods, 2012 and 2017 respectively. Secondly, the three cities studied in this research, namely, Ziar, Ezhieh and Varzaneh are very important cities in the east of Isfahan. Thirdly, these three cities are Zayande rood legal and historic lords due to their occupation. Accordingly, the research seeks to understand the meaning of Ziar, Ezhieh and Varzaneh farmers on the water crisis with the Emic approach and using the method of Anselm Strauss and Juliet Corbin's theoretical approach, namely Grounded Theory. The questions of this research are:  What causes or causes of water crisis from the perspective of the farmers of Ziar, Eziyeh and Varzaneh? What are the strategies of these farmers in confronting the water crisis? Finally, what are the consequences of the water crisis for farmers Ziar, Eziyeh and Varzaneh? <br />  <br />Material & Methods <br />In this research, qualitative research method has been used. In this study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 farmers from Ziar, Ezhieh and Varzaneh in eastern Isfahan in order to understand the participants' mental world. Sampling was done using purposeful sampling method and theoretical sampling was used to collect data. The sample size and data computation method are of theoretical saturation type. In our study, after 7 interviews, theoretical saturation was achieved, but to ensure more interviews were continued to 17 cases. In this research, simultaneously with the interviews, data coding began and then analyzed using the grounded theory. The data encryption consists of three steps: open coding, central coding, and selective coding. The method of validating the grounded theory is through ""accreditation by members"", ""analytical comparison"" and ""audit technique"". <br />In the present study, in the ""open coding"" stage, 35 initial concepts were extracted, then by central coding we transform them into abstract concepts in the form of 16 main categories. In the ""selective coding"" stage, according to the categories obtained, a ""core category"" was extracted which is considered to be the core of the research. This categories include: Unstable Development, Semi-Finished Project, Lack of National Approach, Lack of Law, The Weakness Political Authority, Economic Monopolies, Changing Climatic Conditions, Urban Migration, Political and Social Frustration, Negotiating with the Government, Rebellion, Increase in Poverty, Increasing Unproductive Businesses, Alternative Economic Strategies, Increasing the cleavage of Nation-State and Security Challenges. <br />In this study, ""bad governance of water"" as a core category of the contextual data was extracted. According to this category, the farmers of Ziar, Ezhieh and Varzaneh understand and interpret the changes that have been made in their lives, or water crisis as a phenomenon associated with the mismanagement of water. Issues such as unsustainable development, semi-integrated water development projects, lack of nationalism and lack of law, and the weakness of political authority all fall under water mismanagement or bad governance of water. Theoretically one of the finest analyzes in the field of economic governance of natural resources, including water, is the discussion of the political economist Elinor Ostrom. She showed how natural resources can be well managed from the groups they use and not the state. This view points out that local institutions are more effective elements in managing common natural resources. From this theoretical view, the study of Zayande rood water basin also shows that during the centuries, local exploiters of Zayande Rood River have been able to manage the sustainable management of this source based on the Sheikh Bahaei Scroll. However, the basin was gradually subjected to a state-owned regime, and thus, in addition to violate of the historic and legal rights, part of the Zayanderud was owned by the state. In this process, the Sheikh Bahaei Scroll, which was once the basis of the actions of the farmers and the sovereignty, was gradually abandoned and has become the place of conflict between the farmer and the state. <br />Finally we try to provide paradigm research model. Based on the research findings, the water crisis in eastern Isfahan is classified into three categories: causal, contextual and effective. Casual Conditions include Unstable Development, Contextual Conditions include lack of law, the weakness of political authority and changing climatic of conditions, Effective Conditions include Semi-Finished Project and Lack of National Approach.  Also in this research the Process and Interactional are Urban Migration, Alternative Economic Strategies, Negotiating with the Government, Political and Social Frustration and Rebellion. And finally, Consequential include Increase in Poverty, Increasing Unproductive Businesses, Economic Monopolies, Widening the Cleavage of Nation-State and Security Challenges. <br />  <br />Discussion of Results & Conclusions <br />In this research, based on the paradigm model, the bad water Governance as the core category and the final answer to the research questions have been extracted. According to this category, the farmers of Ziar, Ezhieh and Varzaneh understand the water crisis as a phenomenon that is directly linked to the mismanagement of water by the government. In fact, the government has been seen as the main culprit for the water crisis by society, which has been the exclusive agent for water governance. This teaches us that collective action in material and economic life requires attention to the various institutional arrangements governing these actions. In the form of these actions, the state must have a fundamental understanding that it is only one of the institutions associated with material life and not only an exclusive entity in this field. But the government in Iran has shown that it has not done so in the Zayande rood  Basin, and that is why it is known by the social structure to blame for the water crisis. Therefore, due to such an understanding in social structure, it is necessary for the government to provide a contextual platform for the perceptual gap to be adjusted. If this gap is wider and more active than before, it can further expand the cleavage between the government and the nation in Iran."

However, CSC efficiency is low, likely due to limited cell survival and engraftment after transplantation. The Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, Y-27632, significantly increased cell survival rate, adhesion, and migration in numerous types of cells, including stem cells, suggesting a common feature of the ROCK-mediated apoptotic pathway that may also exist in human CSCs. In this study, we examine the hypothesis that pretreatment of human CSCs with Y-27632 protects cells from Doxorubicin (Dox) induced apoptosis.c-kit+ CSCs were cultured in CSC medium for 3-5 days followed by 48 hr treatment with 0 to 10 μM Y-27632 alone, 0 to 1.0 μM Dox alone, or Y-27632 followed by Dox (48 hrs). Cell viability, toxicity, proliferation, morphology, migration, Caspase-3 activity, expression levels of apoptotic-related key proteins and c-kit+ were examined. Results showed that 48 hr treatment with Y-27632 alone did not result in great changes in c-kit+ expression, proliferation, Caspase-3 activity, or apoptosis; however cell viability was significantly increased and cell migration was promoted. These effects likely involve the ROCK/Actin pathways. In contrast, 48 hr treatment with Dox alone dramatically increased Caspase-3 activity, resulting in cell death. Although Y-27632 alone did not affect the expression levels of apoptotic-related key factors (p-Akt, Akt, Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, Bax, cleaved Caspase-3, and Caspase-3) under basal conditions, it significantly inhibited the Dox-induced increase in cleaved Caspase-3 and reduced cell death under Dox treatment.We conclude that preconditioning human CSCs with Y-27632 significantly reduces Dox-induced cell death and possibly involves the cleaved Caspase-3 and ROCK/Actin pathways. The beneficial effects of Y-27632 may be applied to stem cell-based therapy to increase cell survival rates after transplantation or to act as a cardiac protective agent for Dox-treated cancer patients."

The active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of Transferon is based on polydispersion of peptides that have been extracted from lysed human leukocytes by a dialysis process and a subsequent ultrafiltration step to select molecules below 10 kDa. To physicochemically characterize the drug product, we developed chromatographic methods and an SDS-PAGE approach to analyze the composition and the overall variability of Transferon. Reversed-phase chromatographic profiles of peptide populations demonstrated batch-to-batch consistency from 10 representative batches that harbored 4 primary peaks with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of less than 7%. Aminogram profiles exhibited 17 proteinogenic amino acids and showed that glycine was the most abundant amino acid, with a relative content of approximately 18%. Further, based on their electrophoretic migration, the peptide populations exhibited a molecular mass of about 10 kDa. Finally, we determined the Transferon fingerprint using a mass spectrometry tool. Because each batch was produced from independent pooled buffy coat samples from healthy donors, supplied by a local blood bank, our results support the consistency of the production of Transferon and reveal its peptide identity with regard to its physicochemical attributes."

Treating cancers requires substantial resources, including skilled personnel, medications, instruments, and funds. Thus, developing cancer prevention and treatment measures is necessary for healthcare personnel and patients alike. P. odoratum (Polygonaceae family) is a plant used as a culinary ingredient. It exhibits several pharmacological activities, such as antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer. Several classes of phytochemical constituents of P. odoratum have been reported. The important ones might be polyphenol and flavonoid derivatives. In this systematic review, the activities of P. odoratum against cancerous cells were determined and summarized. Data were obtained through a systematic search of electronic databases (EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus, Thai Thesis Database, Science Direct and Clinical Key). Eight studies met the eligibility criteria. The cancerous cell lines used in the studies were lymphoma, leukemia, oral, lung, breast, colon, and liver cancer cells. Based on this review, P. odoratum extracts significantly affected Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome-carrying human lymphoblastoid (Raji), mouse lymphocytic leukemia (P388), human acute lymphocytic leukemia (Jurkat), breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), human colon adenocarcinoma (HT-29), human T lymphoblast (MOLT-4), human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL-60), human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), and oral squamous cell carcinoma (SAS, SCC-9, HSC-3) through induction of cell apoptosis, arrest of the cell cycle, inhibition of cell proliferation, migration, and colonization. The molecular mechanism of P. odoratum against cancers was reported to involve suppressing essential proteins required for cell proliferation, colonization, migration, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. They were survivin, cyclin-D, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). The extract of P. odoratum was also involved in the protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway by inhibiting the expression of Akt, phosphorylated Akt, mTOR, and phosphorylated mTOR. From the key results of this review, P. odoratum is a promising chemotherapy and chemopreventive agent. Further investigation of its pharmacological activity and mechanism of action should be conducted using standardized extracts. In vivo experiments and clinical trials are required to confirm the anticancer activity."

Mounting evidence has demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in chemoresistance and tumorigenesis. However, the roles of microRNA-501-5p (miR-501) in doxorubicin resistance and gastric cancer cell proliferation and invasion are still not fully understood. In this study, we identified that BLID (BH3-like motif-containing protein, cell death inducer) was directly regulated by miR-501 at the post-transcriptional level in multiple gastric cancer cell lines. Endogenous miR-501 was higher, whereas BLID was lower, in doxorubicin-resistant gastric cancer SGC7901/ADR cells compared with their parental SGC7901 cells. miR-501 suppressed gastric cancer cell apoptosis, induced resistance to doxorubicin, and enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Subcutaneous injection of miR-501 lentivirus-infected SGC7901 cells resulted in rapid growth of xenograft tumors and resistance to doxorubicin treatment, unlike injection of negative miRNA lentivirus-infected SGC7901 cells. This is achieved at least partially by directly targeting BLID and subsequent inactivation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and phosphorylation of Akt. Taken together, miR-501 induces doxorubicin resistance and enhances the tumorigenesis of gastric cancer cells by suppressing BLID. miR-501 might be a potential target for doxorubicin resistance and gastric cancer therapy.

However, the therapeutic effect of osthole on arthritis has not been explored. In the present study, a collagen-induced arthritis rat model, IL-1β-stimulated SW982 cells, and RA-like fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) were employed to investigate the effect and possible mechanism of osthole on arthritis in vivo and in vitro. Results 20 and 40 mg/kg osthole significantly alleviated collagen-induced arthritic symptoms based on histopathology and clinical arthritis scores, and improved erosion using HE staining. 20 and 40 mg/kg osthole decreased the level of IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 in rats and ameliorated oxidative stress in serum evaluated using ELISA kits. In addition, treatment with 50 and 100 μM osthole for 48 h inhibited 10 ng/ml IL-1β-stimulated proliferation and migration of SW982, and significantly inhibited the expression of matrix metalloproteinases, such as MMP-1, MMP-3 and MMP-13, as detected by western blot. 50 and 100 μM osthole also blocked the generation of IL-6 and TNF-α in IL-1β-stimulated SW982 cells. The NF-κB and MAPK pathways were also inhibited by osthole in IL-1β-treated SW982 cells. Conclusion These results collectively demonstrated that osthole improves collagen-induced arthritis in a rat model and IL-1β-treated SW982 cells through inhibiting inflammation and cellular stress in vivo and in vitro, and osthole might be a promising therapeutic agent for RA."

Key results are presented in a novel phase diagram, which reveals a wide range of spatial patterns including the cell, worm, herd, amoeba, and swarm modes under the dynamic regime and the separation, ghetto, and integration modes under the stationary one. Our model thus provides a generalized framework encompassing both static equilibrium and nonstationary systems to investigate the impact of agent heterogeneity on population dynamics.

The present study aimed at introducing turmeric and its active constituent Curcumin, and investigating the effectiveness of its therapeutic applications especially in dermal wound healing process based on traditional and conventional medicine resources. In the view of traditional medicine, turmeric has antibacterial effects and was used to strengthen the eyes, alleviate liver obstruction and jaundice and improve edema. In modern medicine, the most important reason of using this herb to prevent or slow the progression of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, pulmonary and autoimmune diseases, as well as inflammatory bowel disease is attributed to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Skin regeneration and wound healing is a complex process which includes many cells as well as various processes such as proliferation, cell migration, matrix synthesis and contraction that ultimately leads to recovery of cellular structures and tissue layers. There are many recommendations in traditional medicine that suggest the use of turmeric as an antiseptic therapeutic agent is beneficial in treating the skin injuries and healing of wounds, as well as improving rash, and scabies. Based on the results of the studies reviewed in this paper, due to anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant and angiogenesis activities of curcumin and turmeric, they can accelerate wound healing and improve scars regardless of the type of the wound or the route of the administration of the agent. Also, one of the main effects of this plant on accelerating wound healing is due to its ability to regulation TGF-β1 signaling pathway."

An MA is a software component that can migrate among network nodes by following an assigned itinerary (or path). Instead of transporting data from the nodes to the processing unit (e.g., sink) for data gathering, the MA visits each node, and thus, it performs data gathering locally. The MA has two types of itinerary planning: single-agent itinerary planning (SIP) and multi-agent itinerary planning (MIP). The MIP was introduced to address the drawbacks of the SIP in terms of task duration, energy consumption, and reliability. Despite the advantages of the MIP, determining the optimal itinerary for each MA in the MIP poses a considerable challenge. Most proposed itineraries adopt a static itinerary in which the nodes to be visited by the MA are predetermined at the sink node. The distance among nodes is the only parameter that has been used to determine the itinerary of the MA. Other parameters, such as the remaining energy and a number of neighbors, have not been considered. This omission can negatively impact MA migration and result in an unsuccessful MA round-trip, particularly when the remaining energy of the node is insufficient to transfer an MA to the next hop. In this paper, a fuzzy-based MA migration approach (FuMAM) is proposed to determine appropriate itinerary for an MA by considering three parameters: distance, remaining energy, and a number of neighbors. Simulation experiments show that the FuMAM approach improves the rate of the successful MA round-trip and network lifetime. Moreover, the proposed FuMAM approach outperforms the compared algorithms in terms of energy distribution usage among nodes."

There is an urgent need for discovering novel antitumor agents or therapeutic strategies for SCLC. Materials and methods: We performed a screening method based on CCK-8 assay to screen 640 natural compounds for SCLC. The effects of Sanguinarine chloride on SCLC cell proliferation, colony formation, cell cycle, apoptosis, migration and invasion were determined. RNA-seq and bioinformatics analysis was performed to investigate the anti-SCLC mechanism of Sanguinarine chloride. Publicly available datasets and samples were analyzed to investigate the expression level of CDKN1A and its clinical significance. Loss of functional cancer cell models were constructed by shRNA-mediated silencing. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot were used to measure gene and protein expression. Immunohistochemistry staining was performed to detect the expression of CDKN1A, Ki67, and Cleaved caspase 3 in xenograft tissues. Results: We identified Sanguinarine chloride as a potential inhibitor of SCLC, which inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, cell cycle, cell migration and invasion, and promoted apoptosis of SCLC cells. Sanguinarine chloride played an important role in anti-SCLC by upregulating the expression of CDKN1A. Furthermore, Sanguinarine chloride in combination with panobinostat, or THZ1, or gemcitabine, or (+)-JQ-1 increased the anti-SCLC effect compared with either agent alone treatment. Conclusions: Our findings identified Sanguinarine chloride as a potential inhibitor of SCLC by upregulating the expression of CDKN1A. Sanguinarine chloride in combination with chemotherapy compounds exhibited strong synergism anti-SCLC properties, which could be further clinically explored for the treatment of SCLC."

In complex distributed systems a distribution of many jobs of different types is required. At the same time, a problem of virtual machines migration to physical servers must be solved. Therefore, configuration of a cloud system may be very dynamic, meaning that not only number of existing computational servers but also their location on physical servers might change. Optimal control strategies aimed to solve these problems are effective only when updated information about system's components is available. However, gathering this information from many distributed components of a cloud system, such as physical nodes or virtual machines may significantly decrease overall performance. These problems can be solved by applying different optimization techniques such as multi-agent approach. Agents decide if the information is outdated and needs to be updated by them. This paper describes a cloud system architecture that uses agents of different types. Agents' algorithms and their interaction schemes are defined.

Multimodal treatment is empiric and prognosis remains poor. Recurrent PIK3CA missense mutations (PIK3CAmut) in GBM are restricted to three functional domains: adaptor binding (ABD), helical, and kinase. Defining how these mutations influence gliomagenesis and response to kinase inhibitors may aid in the clinical development of novel targeted therapies in biomarker-stratified patients.<h4>Methods</h4>We used normal human astrocytes immortalized via expression of hTERT, E6, and E7 (NHA). We selected two PIK3CAmut from each of 3 mutated domains and induced their expression in NHA with (NHARAS) and without mutant RAS using lentiviral vectors. We then examined the role of PIK3CAmut in gliomagenesis in vitro and in mice, as well as response to targeted PI3K (PI3Ki) and MEK (MEKi) inhibitors in vitro.<h4>Results</h4>PIK3CAmut, particularly helical and kinase domain mutations, potentiated proximal PI3K signaling and migration of NHA and NHARAS in vitro. Only kinase domain mutations promoted NHA colony formation, but both helical and kinase domain mutations promoted NHARAS tumorigenesis in vivo. PIK3CAmut status had minimal effects on PI3Ki and MEKi efficacy. However, PI3Ki/MEKi synergism was pronounced in NHA and NHARAS harboring ABD or helical mutations.<h4>Conclusion</h4>PIK3CAmut promoted differential gliomagenesis based on the mutated domain. While PIK3CAmut did not influence sensitivity to single agent PI3Ki, they did alter PI3Ki/MEKi synergism. Taken together, our results demonstrate that a subset of PIK3CAmut promote tumorigenesis and suggest that patients with helical domain mutations may be most sensitive to dual PI3Ki/MEKi treatment."

Metastases are often more dangerous than the primary tumor and they are responsible for 90% of all cancer deaths.  The purpose of this study is to explore the anti-metastatic activities of the PGB-0 complex with fructose (PGB-0-F) against 4T1 breast cancer cells. Scratch wound healing assay was performed to determine migration inhibition ability of PGB-0-F, while MMP-9 expression were analysed by gelatin zymography.  The testing of anti-migration activity showed that PGB-0-F inhibited  in 4T1 cells, whereas in gelatin zymography assay showed the suppression of MMP-9 expression. PGB-0-F inhibited closure on 4T1 metastatic breast cancer cells line compared to control. PGB-0-F decreased MMP-9 expression level compared to control. Based these results, PGB-0-F has a potency to be developed as chemotherapeutic agent especially as anti-metastatic agent"

Current treatment is palliative, making necessary the development of new therapeutic strategies to offer alternatives to patients. Therefore, endophytes represent an interesting source of natural metabolites with anticancer potential. These microorganisms reside in tissues of living plants and act to improve their growth. Evidence revealed that several medicinal plants are colonized by endophytic fungi producer of antitumor metabolites. Achyrocline satureioides is a Brazilian medicinal plant characterized by its properties against gastrointestinal disturbances, anticancer and antioxidant effects. However, there are no reports describing the endophytic composition of A. satureioides. The present study proposes the isolation of endophytic fungus from A. satureioides, extract preparation, phytochemical characterization and evaluation of its antiglioma potential. Our data showed that crude extracts of endophyte decreased glioma viability with IC50 values of 1.60–1.63 μg/mL to eDCM (dichloromethane extract) and 37.30–55.12 μg/mL to eEtAc (ethyl acetate extract), respectively. Crude extracts induced cell death by apoptosis with modulation of redox status. In order to bioprospect anticancer metabolites, endophytic fungus extracts were subjected to guided fractionation and purification yielded five fractions of each extract. Six of ten fractions showed selective antiproliferative activity against glioma cells, with IC50 values ranged from 0.95 to 131.3 μg/mL. F3DCM (from eDCM) and F3EtAc (from eEtAc) fractions promoted C6 glioma toxicity with IC50 of 1.0 and 27.05 μg/mL, respectively. F3EtAc fraction induced late apoptosis and arrest in G2/M stage, while F3DCM promoted apoptosis with arrest in Sub-G1 phase. Moreover, F3DCM increased antioxidant defense and decreased ROS production. Additionally, F3DCM showed no cytotoxic activity against astrocytes, revealing selective effect. Based on promising potential of F3DCM, we identified the production of Sch-642305, a lactone, which showed antiproliferative properties with IC50 values of 1.1 and 7.6 μg/mL to C6 and U138MG gliomas, respectively. Sch-642305 promoted arrest on cell cycle in G2/M inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, this lactone decreased glioma cell migration and modulated redox status, increasing superoxide dismutase and catalase activities and enhancing sulfhydryl content, consequently suppressing reactive species of oxygen generation. Taken together, these results indicate that metabolites produced by endophytic fungus isolated from A. satureioides have therapeutic potential as antiglioma agent."

To try to reconcile these into an easily visualized 3D model of wound healing amenable for experimentation by cell biologists, a multiscale model of the formation of a 3D skin epithelium was established with TGF-beta1 literature-derived rule sets and equations embedded within it. At the cellular level, an agent-based bottom-up model that focuses on individual interacting units (keratinocytes) was used. This was based on literature-derived rules governing keratinocyte behavior and keratinocyte/ECM interactions. The selection of these rule sets is described in detail in this paper. The agent-based model was then linked with a subcellular model of TGF-beta1 production and its action on keratinocytes simulated with a complex pathway simulator. This multiscale model can be run at a cellular level only or at a combined cellular/subcellular level. It was then initially challenged (by wounding) to investigate the behavior of keratinocytes in wound healing at the cellular level. To investigate the possible actions of TGF-beta1, several hypotheses were then explored by deliberately manipulating some of these rule sets at subcellular levels. This exercise readily eliminated some hypotheses and identified a sequence of spatial-temporal actions of TGF-beta1 for normal successful wound healing in an easy-to-follow 3D model. We suggest this multiscale model offers a valuable, easy-to-visualize aid to our understanding of the actions of this key regulator in wound healing, and provides a model that can now be used to explore pathologies of wound healing."

To investigate the underlying cell organisation principles of organoids, we imaged hundreds of pancreas and cholangiocarcinoma organoids in parallel using light sheet and bright-field microscopy for up to 7 days. Results We quantified organoid behaviour at single-cell (microscale), individual-organoid (mesoscale), and entire-culture (macroscale) levels. At single-cell resolution, we monitored formation, monolayer polarisation, and degeneration and identified diverse behaviours, including lumen expansion and decline (size oscillation), migration, rotation, and multi-organoid fusion. Detailed individual organoid quantifications lead to a mechanical 3D agent-based model. A derived scaling law and simulations support the hypotheses that size oscillations depend on organoid properties and cell division dynamics, which is confirmed by bright-field microscopy analysis of entire cultures. Conclusion Our multiscale analysis provides a systematic picture of the diversity of cell organisation in organoids by identifying and quantifying the core regulatory principles of organoid morphogenesis."

The survival rate of the patient is still arguably low even with intensive treatment provided, plus with the inherent side effects from the chemotherapy, which gives more unfavorable outcomes. Hence, the search for potent anti-osteosarcoma agent with promising safety profile is still on going. Natural occurring substance like curcumin has gained a lot of attention due to its splendid safety profile as well as it pharmacological advantages such as anti-metastasis and anti-angiogenesis. However, natural curcumin was widely known for its poor cellular uptake, which undermines all potential that it possesses. This prompted the development of synthetically synthesized curcuminoid analog, known as (Z)-3-hydroxy-1-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylprop-2- en-1-one (DK1). In this present study, in vitro scratch assay, transwell migration/invasion assay, HUVEC tube formation assay, and ex vivo rat aortic ring assays were performed in order to investigate the anti-metastatic and anti-angiogenic potential of DK1. For further comprehension of DK1 mechanism on human osteosarcoma cell lines, microarray gene expression analysis, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and proteome profiler were adopted, providing valuable forecast from the expression of important genes and proteins related to metastasis and angiogenesis. Based on the data gathered from the bioassays, DK1 was able to inhibit the metastasis and angiogenesis of human osteosarcoma cell lines by significantly reducing the cell motility, number of migrated and invaded cells as well as the tube formation and micro-vessels sprouting. Additionally, DK1 also has significantly regulated several cancer pathways involved in OS proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis such as PI3K/Akt and NF-κB in both U-2 OS and MG-63. Regulation of PI3K/Akt caused up-regulation of genes related to metastasis inhibition, namely, PTEN, FOXO, PLK3, and GADD45A. Meanwhile, NF-κB pathway was regulated by mitigating the expression of NF-κB activator such as IKBKB and IKBKE in MG-63, whilst up-regulating the expression of NF-κB inhibitors such as NFKBIA and NFKBIE in U-2 OS. Finally, DK1 also has successfully hindered the metastatic and angiogenic capability of OS cell lines by down-regulating the expression of pro-metastatic genes and proteins like MMP3, COL11A1, FGF1, Endoglin, uPA, and IGFBP2 in U-2 OS. Whilst for MG-63, the significantly down-regulated oncogenes were Serpin E1, AKT2, VEGF, uPA, PD-ECGF, and Endoglin. These results suggest that curcumin analog DK1 may serve as a potential new anti-osteosarcoma agent due to its anti-metastatic and anti-angiogenic attributes."

Interaction of β-catenin with Transcription factor 4 (TCF4) is a key step for the activation of Wnt genes in response to upstream signals of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Hence, down regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling or targeting downstream events by selective β-catenin/TCF4 protein–protein interaction inhibitors could be a potential therapeutic strategy against such cancers. In this study structure-based drug design approach was followed to design novel 4,7-disubstituted 8-methoxyquinazoline-based derivatives which could act as potential cytotoxic agents inhibiting the β-catenin/TCF4 protein–protein interactions. Fifteen compounds possessing 4,7-disubstituted 8-methoxyquinazoline scaffold were synthesized. Cytotoxic potential of the synthesised derivatives were determined against constitutively activated β-catenin/TCF4 signaling pathway cancer cells (HCT116 and HepG2) using the sulforhodamine B assay. The most potent compound (18B) was selected for detailed biological evaluation. Cell morphology, Hoechst 33342 and Annexin V/PI staining were used to detect apoptosis, while inhibition of cell migration was assessed by in vitro wound healing assay against HCT116 and HepG2 cells. Effect on β-catenin/TCF mediated transcriptional activity was assessed by TOPFlash/FOPFlash assay, TCF4 and β-catenin protein expression by immunocytofluorescence, and Wnt target genes (like c-MYC and Cyclin D1) mRNA levels by RT-PCR against HCT116 cells. Cytotoxic potency of the most potential compound (18B) against primary human gallbladder cancer cells was also evaluated. The derivatives showed interactions with active site residues of β-catenin and were capable of hindering the TCF4 binding, thereby disrupting β-catenin/TCF4 interactions. Cytotoxic potencies (IC50) of these derivatives ranged from 5.64 ± 0.68 to 23.18 ± 0.45 μM against HCT116 and HepG2 cells respectively. Compound (18B), the most potent compound among the series, induced apoptosis and inhibited cell migration against HCT116 and HepG2 cells. Mechanistic studies indicated that compound (18B) downregulated β-catenin/TCF4 signaling pathway, β-catenin and TCF4 protein expression, and mRNA levels of c-MYC andCyclin D1 in HCT116 cells and showed cytotoxicity against primary human gallbladder cancer cells with IC50 value of 8.50 ± 1.44 μM. Thus, novel 4,7-disubstituted 8-methoxyquinazoline derivatives were identified as potential cytotoxic agents with potencies comparable to that of imatinib mesylate. Compound (18B) represents a promising lead molecule as anticancer agent against colon, hepatocellular and gallbladder cancers targeting β-catenin/TCF4 signaling pathway."

The low-risk alternative for women with uncomplicated SUI is the bulking agent, which aims to achieve continence through coaptation of the urethra. Two classes of bulking agents can be identified: those made from solid microparticles in an absorbable liquid or gel carrier (particulate agents) and those comprising a homogenous gel (non-particulates) that resists absorption. Polydimethylsiloxane&reg;, carbon-coated zirconium oxide&reg;, calcium hydroxyapatite&reg; and polyacrylate polyalcohol copolymer&reg; are currently marketed particulate agents. With the exception of calcium hydroxyapatite, the particles are non-degradable. Each agent achieves its long-term bulking effect through reactive changes around the persisting particles while the carrier volume is lost. Bulkamid&reg; is a non-particulate agent with the bulking effect resulting from the volume of gel injected. The lasting network of fine fibers formed by the host tissue anchors the gel in situ. Foreign-body granulomas, erosion and migration/material extrusion and loss of bulk have been observed in connection with the particle-based products. Bulkamid may be mechanistically less liable to these events; however, there are minimal data directly comparing the two types of bulking agent. The question of durability is inevitable based on their differing modes of action.Keywords: stress urinary incontinence, bulking agents, safety, particulate, non-particulate"

Recently, many natural compounds have been highlighted as a valuable source of new and less toxic drugs to enhance breast cancer therapy. Among them, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) has emerged as a promising anti-cancer agent. MicroRNA (miRNA or miR)-based gene therapy provides an interesting antitumor approach to integrated cancer therapy. In this study, we evaluated AdoMet-induced modulation of miRNA-34c and miRNA-449a expression in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 TNBC cells. We demonstrated that AdoMet upregulates miR-34c and miR-449a expression in both cell lines. We found that the combination of AdoMet with miR-34c or miR-449a mimic strongly potentiated the pro-apoptotic effect of the sulfonium compound by a caspase-dependent mechanism. For the first time, by video time-lapse microscopy, we showed that AdoMet inhibited the in vitro migration of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells and that the combination with miR-34c or miR-449a mimic strengthened the effect of the sulfonium compound through the modulation of β-catenin and Small Mother Against Decapentaplegic (SMAD) signaling pathways.

First; we used an adhesion assay to test the A375.S2 cells&#x2019; adhesion ability after treatment with casticin. We next investigated the cell migration ability after casticin treatment by using a wound healing assay to prove that the migration of A375.S2 cells can be inhibited by casticin and double checked the results using the transwell-migration assay. The suppressive effects on matrix metalloproteinase-2; and -9 (MMP-2; and -9) activities were examined by gelatin zymography. Furthermore, western blotting was used to investigate the protein level changes in A375.S2 cells. We found that p-EGFR; Ras and p-ERK1/2 are decreased by casticin, indicating that casticin can down-regulate the migration and invasion ability of A375.S2 cells via the p-EGFR/Ras/p-ERK pathway. The NF-&#x3BA;B p65 and p-ERK levels in nuclear proteins are also decreased by treatment with casticin. An EMSA assay also discovered that the NF-&#x3BA;B p65 and DNA interaction is decreased. NF-&#x3BA;B p65 protein level was examined by immunofluorescence staining and also decreased. Our findings suggest that casticin has anti-metastatic potential by decreasing the invasiveness of A375.S2 cells. We also found that casticin suppressed A375.S2 cell proliferation and cell adhesion ability, but did not affect cell death, as examined using cytometry and a collagen adhesion assay. Based on these observations, casticin could be used as an inhibitor of migration and invasion of human melanoma cells in the future."

Increased heterogeneity is argued to decrease trust and diversify interests between resource users, leading to overuse and decline of natural and man-made CPRs. The aim of this paper is to understand cooperative behaviour under economic and sociocultural heterogeneity in CPRs, through the analyses of experimental data including 344 subjects from the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, and 144 subjects from India. Multilevel regression, ordinal logistic regression, linear conditional-contribution profiles [LCPs] and agent-based models [ABMs] are used to analyse and replicate experimental outcomes on the micro- and macro-level. Results show that the combination of economic and sociocultural heterogeneity affects cooperation negatively when the decision-situation is perceived as unfair, but that neither economic nor sociocultural heterogeneity on themselves affect cooperation negatively. Economic heterogeneity is even found to affect cooperation positively relative to homogeneity. Player type classification based on LCP scores shows that experimental outcomes can be interpreted with player types, and ABM simulations validate the experimental results by replicating the main outcomes."

Methods We developed a novel physical approach to produce a cell-free aqueous extract from human fat tissue (fat extract (FE)). The therapeutic potential of FE was investigated in the ischemic hindlimb model of nude mice. After establishment of hindlimb ischemia with ligation of the left femoral artery and intramuscular injection of FE, blood perfusion was monitored at days 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28. Tissue necrosis and capillary density were evaluated. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to analyze the growth factors contained in FE. Moreover, the proliferation, migration, and tube formation ability were tested on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro when treated with FE. The proangiogenic ability of FE was further assessed in an in-vivo Matrigel plug assay. Results FE was prepared and characterized. The intramuscular injection of FE into the ischemic hindlimb of mice attenuated severe limb loss and increased blood flow and capillary density of the ischemic tissue. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that FE contained high levels of various growth factors. When added as a cell culture supplement, FE promoted HUVEC proliferation, migration, and tube formation ability in a dose-dependent manner. The subcutaneous injection of Matrigel infused with FE enhanced vascular formation. Conclusions We developed a novel cell-free therapeutic agent, FE, produced from human adipose tissue. FE was able to attenuate ischemic injury and stimulate angiogenesis in ischemic tissues. This study indicates that FE may represent a novel cell-free therapeutic agent in the treatment of ischemic disorders."

Vitamins are one of the most important micronutrients, which play great roles in many biochemical reactions inside the cells and cell pathways affecting various cellular functions. Here the effects of essential vitamins on angiogenesis are overviewed. An electronic search was performed in PubMed database via OVID from January 2000 to February 2017 using the keywords regarding the effects of vitamins on angiogenesis. Of the 911 articles found in our initial search only 126 met the inclusion criteria. Vitamin A, both 13-cis retinoid acid and acyclic acid inhibit angiogenesis by suppressing VEGF, while all trans retinoid acid induces angiogenesis by enhancing the expression of proangiogenic factors and reducing pro-MMP2 activity. Vitamin B1, Thiamine, simulates angiogenesis by inducing proliferation of human endothelial progenitor cells and inhibiting apoptosis via PKB/Akt-mediated potentiation. Vitamin B2, Riboflavin, inhibits angiogenesis by decreasing phosphorylation of Src tyrosine 16, an activator residue of Src kinase, and a key player in angiogenesis. Vitamin B3, Niacin, acts as a proangiogenic substance by acting as a precursor of NAD+, as well as promoting endothelial cell function via its receptor GPR109A. Vitamin B6 inhibits angiogenesis by inhibiting micro vessel outgrowth and suppressing the proliferation of endothelial cells. Vitamin B9, Folic acid, inhibits angiogenesis by decreasing proliferation of endothelial cells, as well as activating Src/ERK2/NF-κB/p53 signaling pathways, resulting in cell cycle arrest. Vitamin B12, Cobalamin, acts as a pro-angiogenic substance by inducing production of NO, prostaglandin E1, and prostacyclin leading to angiogenesis. Furthermore, vitamin B12 reduces homocysteine levels in plasma, which is a significant anti-angiogenesis agent. Vitamin C in high concentrations alters the metabolic activity of endothelial cells; decreasing their ATP levels and cell proliferation. Thus, vitamin C has anti-angiogenic properties. Vitamin D in the 1,25D3 form has anti-proliferative effects by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Vitamin E, Tocopherols, exhibit anti-angiogenic effects by inhibition of proliferation and tube formation of endothelial cells through suppression of signaling pathways that are dependent on activation of PI3K/PDK/Akt signaling. Vitamin K exhibits its antiangiogenic activity by acting on protein S, through inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor-receptor 2 (VEGFR2)-dependent vascularization as well as VEGF induced endothelial cell migration and proliferation.According to the studies evaluated here, vitamins A, B, C, D, E and K exhibit pro- or anti-angiogenic activities based on their derivatives and physiological settings. Vitamin A shows both anti- and pro-angiogenesis activity while Vitamins B2, B6, B9, C, D, E and K have anti-angiogenic properties and Vitamins B1 and B3 are proangiogenesis."

In this work, we carried out fundamental in vitro and in vivo experiments to assess the labeling efficacy of our novel theranostic nanoprobe, consisting of glycogen conjugated with a red fluorescent probe and gadolinium. Microscopy and resazurin viability assays were used to study cell labeling and cell viability in human metastatic melanoma cell lines. Fluorescence lifetime correlation spectroscopy (FLCS) was done to investigate nanoprobe stability. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to study T1 relaxivity in vitro, and contrast enhancement in a subcutaneous in vivo tumor model. Efficient cell labeling was demonstrated, while cell viability, cell migration, and cell growth was not affected. FLCS showed that the nanoprobe did not degrade in blood plasma. MRI demonstrated that down to 750 cells/μL of labeled cells in agar phantoms could be detected. In vivo MRI showed that contrast enhancement in tumors was comparable between Omniscan contrast agent  and the nanoprobe. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that a non-toxic glycogen-based nanoprobe may effectively visualize tumor cells and tissue, and, in future experiments, we will investigate its therapeutic potential by conjugating therapeutic compounds to the nanoprobe."

Concentration-effect curves for the influence of GJH on cellular proliferation showed a biphasic shape. Besides, GJH had a synergistic effect on cytotoxicity when combined with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)which may be due to the alternation of the chemotherapeutic agent resistance-related genes and due to the synergistic effects on apoptosis. In addition, treatment with GJH extract markedly reduced 786-O cell adherence to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and decreased 786-O cell migration and invasion. In a xenograft animal model, GJH extract had an inhibitory effect on tumor cell-induced metastasis. Moreover, western blot analysis showed that the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in 786-O cells was significantly decreased by treatment with GJH extract through inactivation of nuclear factor-κB (NF--κB). These results suggest that GJH extract has a synergistic effect on apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents and an inhibitory effect on cell adhesion, migration, and invasion, providing evidence for the use of water-based extracts of GJH as novel alternative therapeutic agents in the treatment of human renal cancer."

Prion diseases may arise spontaneously, be inherited genetically or be acquired by infection and affect a variety of mammalian species including humans. Prion infections in the central nervous system (CNS) cause extensive neuropathology, including abnormal accumulations of misfolded host prion protein, vacuolar change resulting in sponge-like (spongiform) appearance of CNS tissue, neurodegeneration and reactive glial responses. Many different prion agent strains exist and these can differ based on disease duration, clinical signs and the targeting and distribution of the neuropathology in distinct brain areas. Reactive astrocytes are a prominent feature in the prion disease affected CNS as revealed by distinct morphological changes and upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). The CD44 antigen is a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in cell-cell interactions, cell adhesion and migration. Here we show that CD44 is also highly expressed in a subset of reactive astrocytes in regions of the CNS targeted by prions. Astrocyte heterogeneity revealed by differential CD44 upregulation occurs coincident with the earliest neuropathological changes during the pre-clinical phase of disease, and is not affected by the route of infection. The expression and distribution of CD44 was compared in brains from a large collection of 15 distinct prion agent strains transmitted to mice of different prion protein (Prnp) genotype backgrounds. Our data show that the pattern of CD44 upregulation observed in the hippocampus in each prion agent strain and host Prnp genotype combination was unique. Many mouse-adapted prion strains and hosts have previously been characterized based on the pattern of the distribution of the spongiform pathology or the misfolded PrP deposition within the brain. Our data show that CD44 expression also provides a reliable discriminatory marker of prion infection with a greater dynamic range than misfolded prion protein deposition, aiding strain identification. Together, our data reveal CD44 as a novel marker to detect reactive astrocyte heterogeneity during CNS prion disease and for enhanced identification of distinct prion agent strains."

Treatment with chemotherapy has variable response rates leading to most dogs succumbing to their disease within a year. Cannabidiol is an emerging treatment within the field of oncology. In reported in vivo studies, cannabidiol has induced apoptosis, reduced cell migration, and acted as a chemotherapy sensitizer in various human tumor types. The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of cannabidiol on canine urothelial carcinoma cell viability and apoptosis as both a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy in vitro. <h4>Results</h4> Cannabidiol reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis in canine urothelial cells as determined by crystal violet viability assay and annexin V/propidium iodide flow cytometry. Furthermore, combinations of cannabidiol with mitoxantrone and vinblastine chemotherapy yielded significantly reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis compared to single agent treatment alone. The drug interactions were deemed synergistic based on combination index calculations. Conversely, the combination of cannabidiol and carboplatin did not result in decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis compared to single agent treatment. Combination index calculations suggested an antagonistic interaction between these drugs. Finally, the combination of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug piroxicam with cannabidiol did not significantly affect cell viability, although, some cell lines demonstrated decreased cell viability when mitoxantrone was combined with piroxicam. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Cannabidiol showed promising results as a single agent or in combination with mitoxantrone and vinblastine for treatment of canine urothelial carcinoma cells. Further studies are justified to investigate whether these results are translatable in vivo."

Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is major cancer type due to its poor prognosis even after treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs, which causes a variety of side effects in patients. Therefore, efforts have been made to develop effective biomarkers in the treatment of HCC in order to improve therapeutic outcomes using natural based agents. The current study used SCU as a treatment approach against HCC using the HepG2 cell line. Based on the cell viability assessment up to a 200 μM concentration of SCU, three low-toxic concentrations of (25, 50, and 100) μM were adopted for further investigation. SCU induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and inhibited cell migration and proliferation in HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, increased PTEN expression by SCU led to the subsequent downregulation of PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway related proteins. In addition, SCU regulated the metastasis with EMT and migration-related proteins in HepG2 cells. In summary, SCU inhibits cell proliferation and metastasis in HepG2 cells through PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling by upregulation of PTEN, suggesting that SCU might be used as a potential agent for HCC therapy."

In the lung, it is able to quickly adapt to the humid environment and, if not removed within a time frame of 4-8 hours, the pathogen may cause damage by germination and invasive growth. Applying a to-scale agent-based model of human alveoli to simulate early A. fumigatus infection under physiological conditions, we recently demonstrated that alveolar macrophages require chemotactic cues to accomplish the task of pathogen detection in time. The objective of this study is to specify our phenomenological prediction on the as yet unidentified chemokine by a quantitative analysis of its expected properties, such as the diffusion coefficient and the rates of secretion and degradation. To this end, the rule-based implementation of chemokine diffusion in the initial agent-based model is revised by numerically solving the spatio-temporal reaction-diffusion equation in the complex structure of the alveolus. In this hybrid agent-based model, alveolar macrophages are represented as migrating agents that are coupled to the interactive layer of diffusing molecule concentrations by the kinetics of chemokine receptor binding, internalization and re-expression. Performing simulations for more than a million virtual infection scenarios, we find that the ratio of secretion rate to the diffusion coefficient is the main indicator for the success of pathogen detection. Moreover, a subdivision of the parameter space into regimes of successful and unsuccessful parameter combination by this ratio is specific for values of the migration speed and the directional persistence time of alveolar macrophages, but depends only weakly on chemokine degradation rates."

Since humans inhale hundreds to thousands of fungal conidia every day, the lower respiratory tract is the primary site of infection. Current interaction networks of the innate immune response attribute fungal recognition and detection to alveolar macrophages, which are thought to be the first cells to get in contact with the fungus. At present, these networks are derived from in vitro or in situ assays, as the peculiar physiology of the human lung makes in vivo experiments, including imaging on the cell-level, hard to realize. We implemented a spatio-temporal agent-based model of a human alveolus in order to perform in silico experiments of a virtual infection scenario, for an alveolus infected with A. fumigatus under physiological conditions. The virtual analog captures the three-dimensional alveolar morphology consisting of the two major alveolar epithelial cell types and the pores of Kohn as well as the dynamic process of respiration. To the best of our knowledge this is the first agent-based model of a dynamic human alveolus in the presence of respiration. A key readout of our simulations is the first-passage-time of alveolar macrophages, which is the period of time that elapses until the first physical macrophage-conidium contact is established. We tested for random and chemotactic migration modes of alveolar macrophages and varied their corresponding parameter sets. The resulting first-passage-time distributions imply that randomly migrating macrophages fail to find the conidium before the start of germination, whereas guidance by chemotactic signals derived from the alveolar epithelial cell associated with the fungus enables a secure and successful discovery of the pathogen in time."

Emerging evidence suggests that ZA has anti-tumor and anti-metastatic properties for breast cancer cells. In a mouse model of ZA-related osteonecrosis of the jaw, ZA administration was found to suppress regulatory T-cells (Tregs) function. Our previous reports also demonstrated ZA acted as an immune modulator to block Tregs. Manipulation of Tregs represents a new strategy for cancer treatment. However, the relationship among ZA, Tregs, and cancer cells remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of ZA on the interaction of breast cancer cells and Tregs. Methods The anti-tumor effect of ZA on triple negative breast cancer cell lines were validated by XTT, wound healing and apoptosis analysis. A flow cytometry-based assay was used to analyze the immunosuppressive effect of Tregs treated with media conditioned by breast cancer cells, and a transwell assay was used to evaluate the chemotactic migration of Tregs. Differential gene expression profile on MDA-MB-231 treated with ZA (25 μM) was analyzed by. microarrays to describe the molecular basis of actions of ZA for possible direct anti-tumor effects. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and quantitative real-time PCR were used to investigate the effect of ZA on the expression of cytokines/factors by breast cancer cells. Results ZA was found to inhibit the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. Media conditioned by the MDA-MB-231 cells promoted the expansion, chemotactic migration, and immunosuppressive activity of Tregs, and these effects were attenuated in a dose-dependent manner by ZA treatment, and the attenuation was due to reduced expression of selected breast cancer cell factors (CCL2, CCL5, and IDO). Conclusions ZA can significantly affect the interaction between breast cancer cells and Tregs. Our findings indicate that ZA is a potential therapeutic agent that can be used to reduce cancer aggressiveness by abolishing the supportive role of Tregs."

These patterns are the result of chemical gradients that are created from the directed movement and metabolic activity of billions of cells. A recent study on pattern formation in wild bacterial isolates has revealed unique collective behaviors of the bacteria Enterobacter cloacae. As in other bacterial species, Enterobacter cloacae form macroscopic aggregates. Once formed, these bacterial clusters can migrate several millimeters, sometimes resulting in the merging of two or more clusters. To better understand these phenomena, we examine the formation and dynamics of thousands of bacterial clusters that form within a 22 cm square culture dish filled with soft agar over two days. At the macroscale, the aggregates display spatial order at short length scales, and the migration of cell clusters is superdiffusive, with a merging acceleration that is correlated with aggregate size. At the microscale, aggregates are composed of immotile cells surrounded by low density regions of motile cells. The collective movement of the aggregates is the result of an asymmetric flux of bacteria at the boundary. An agent-based model is developed to examine how these phenomena are the result of both chemotactic movement and a change in motility at high cell density. These results identify and characterize a new mechanism for collective bacterial motility driven by a transient, density-dependent change in motility."

However, the practical application of aqueous ZIBs at low temperature environment is hindered by the freezing aqueous electrolytes, which leads to a sharp drop in ionic conductivity, and thereby a rapid deterioration of battery performance. Herein, a chaotropic salt electrolyte based on low concentration aqueous Zn(ClO4)2 with superior ionic conductivity under low temperature (4.23 mS/cm at −50°C) is reported. The anti‐freezing methodology introduced here is completely different from conventional freeze‐resistant design of using “water‐in‐salt” electrolyte, cosolvents, or anti‐freezing agent additives strategy. Experimental analysis and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the as‐prepared Zn(ClO4)2 electrolyte possesses faster ionic migration compared with other commonly used Zn‐based salts (i.e., Zn(CF3SO3)2 and ZnSO4) electrolyte. It is found that Zn(ClO4)2 electrolyte can suppress the ice crystal construction by forming more hydrogen bonds between solute ClO4− and solvent H2O molecules, thus leading to a superior anti‐freezing property. The fabricated ZIBs using this aqueous electrolyte exhibits a dramatically enhanced specific capacity, remarkable rate capability, and great cycling stability over a wide temperature range, from −50 to 25°C. The aqueous ZIBs also exhibit an outstanding energy density of 238.4 Wh/kg without compromising the power density (7.9 kW/kg) under −20°C. Moreover, the assembled aqueous ZIBs can also cycle stably over 1000 cycles at an ultra‐low −50°C.

A spatial model using Agent Based Modelling (ABM) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) is proposed to model disaggregate future changes in land-use patterns given forecast population estimates and planning policies. The two main impacts considered are housing shortage and traffic congestion, as these are the two most significant social impacts for Kuwaitis. This article discusses the design methodology and parameterization of the ABM and the agent groups. It characterizes urban growth by rules for different citizen groups, historical growth patterns and the influence of decision-makers. The model is validated against data for the period 1995-2015 and simulations run to 2050; the results predict that continued city-centric growth will aggravate the problems, with more than 50% increase in housing shortage and congestion unless the government intervenes to rectify the situation."

Disintegrins are small and cysteine-rich proteins present in snake venoms and can interact with specific integrins to inhibit their activities in cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions. These molecules, known to inhibit platelet aggregation, are also capable of interacting with certain cancer-related integrins, and may interfere in important processes involved in carcinogenesis. Therefore, disintegrin from Crotalus durissus collilineatus venom was isolated, structurally characterized and evaluated for its toxicity and ability to interfere with cell proliferation and migration in MDA-MB-231, a human breast cancer cell line. Methods Based on previous studies, disintegrin was isolated by FPLC, through two chromatographic steps, both on reversed phase C-18 columns. The isolated disintegrin was structurally characterized by Tris-Tricine-SDS-PAGE, mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing. For the functional assays, MTT and wound-healing assays were performed in order to investigate cytotoxicity and effect on cell migration in vitro, respectively. Results Disintegrin presented a molecular mass of 7287.4 Da and its amino acid sequence shared similarity with the disintegrin domain of P-II metalloproteases. Using functional assays, the disintegrin showed low cytotoxicity (15% and 17%, at 3 and 6 μg/mL, respectively) after 24 h of incubation and in the wound-healing assay, the disintegrin (3 μg/mL) was able to significantly inhibit cell migration (24%, p < 0.05), compared to negative control. Conclusion Thus, our results demonstrate that non-RGD disintegrin from C. d. collilineatus induces low cytotoxicity and inhibits migration of human breast cancer cells. Therefore, it may be a very useful molecular tool for understanding ECM-cell interaction cancer-related mechanisms involved in an important integrin family that highlights molecular aspects of tumorigenesis. Also, non-RGD disintegrin has potential to serve as an agent in anticancer therapy or adjuvant component combined with other anticancer drugs."

However, radiation-induced tumor cell death is limited by a number of factors, including the adverse response of the tumor microenvironment to the treatment and either intrinsic or acquired mechanisms of evasive resistance, and the existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs).  In this study, we demonstrated that using different doses of irradiation led to the enrichment of CD133+ Mahlavu cells using flow cytometric method. Subsequently, CD133+ Mahlavu cells enriched by irradiation were characterized for their stemness gene expression, self-renewal, migration/invasion abilities,  and radiation resistance. Having established irradiation-enriched CD133+ Mahlavu cells with CSC properties, we evaluated a phytochemical, pterostilbene (PT), found abundantly in blueberries, against irradiation-enriched CSCs.  It was shown that PT treatment dose-dependently reduced the enrichment of CD133+ Mahlavu cells upon irradiation; PT treatment also prevented tumor sphere formation, reduced stemness gene expression, and suppressed invasion and migration abilities as well as increasing apoptosis of CD133+ Mahlavu CSCs. Based on our experimental data, pterostilbene could be used to prevent the enrichment of CD133+ hepatoma CSCs and should be considered for future clinical testing as a combined agent for HCC patients."

Enterovirus infections can vary in clinical manifestations and severity, from asymptomatic infection to serious multisystem diseases. During evolution, enterovirus strains with increased neurovirulence or atypical pathogenicity may emerge exhibiting an epidemic potential. Recently, outbreaks of enterovirus infection with an increased rate of neurological manifestations, a significant percentage of severe cases and lethal outcomes have been observed worldwide, which were associated with enteroviruses EV-A71, EV-D68 etc. The World Health Organization has included EV-A71 and EV-D68 enterovirus infection together with some other dangerous viral diseases considered for inclusion in the List of Blueprint Priority Diseases. In connection with this, global enterovirus surveillance is important for controlling emergence and spread of epidemic enterovirus variants, prediction of establishing epidemic situation, timely conduction of preventive measures and vaccine development. A growing multi-field cooperation between Russia and Vietnam leads to increased two-way population migration, which actualizes scientific and practical collaboration in surveillance and control of infectious disease spread, including enterovirus infection. Currently, epidemiological surveillance of enterovirus infection in Vietnam is based on monitoring hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) rate, laboratory diagnostics of enterovirus infection and identification of enterovirus strains, mainly detected in severe patients. In 2001–2016, 34 non-polio virus types were identified in patients with enterovirus infection, largely represented by viruses EV-A71, CVA6, CVA10, and CVA16. Moreover, the peak incidence of enterovirus infection and related mortality rate were associated with the increased activity of EV-A71 virus. In Vietnam, EVA71 enterovirus of genotypes C1, C4, C5 and B5 circulated at different times. Over the last years, a new pandemic genotype virus CVA6 has been dominating as a causative agent of enterovirus infection in Vietnam as well as the majority of other countries. The data on phylogenetic relation between Vietnamese epidemic EV-A71 and CVA6 strains allowed to find that they underwent multiple betweencountry spreads, whereas their subsequent in-country dissemination resulted in 2011–2012 enterovirus outbreak and sustained high-level HFMD morbidity."

Scaffold pores allow for cell mobility metabolic processes, and delivery of oxygen and nutrients by blood vessel. Thus, pore architecture affects cell seeding efficiency, cell viability, migration, morphology, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, angiogenesis, mechanical strength of scaffolds, and, eventually, bone formation. Therefore, to improve the efficacy of bone regeneration, several important parameters of the pore architecture of scaffolds must be carefully controlled, including pore size, geometry, orientation, uniformity, interconnectivity, and porosity, which are interrelated and whose coordination affects the effectiveness of bone tissue engineering. The honeycomb (HCB) as natural polymeric porogen is used to pore forming agent of scaffolds. It is unique for fully interconnected and oriented pores of uniform size and high mechanical strength in the direction of the pores. The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the effect of HCB concentration on macropore structure of the scaffolds. Methods Bioceramic hydroxyapatite (HA) was synthesized from abalone mussel shells (Halioitis asinina) using a precipitation method, and HA-based scaffolds were fabricated with honeycomb (HCB) as the porogen agent. Pore structure engineering was successfully carried out using HCB at concentrations of 10, 20, and 30 wt%. Results The Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS) analysis revealed that the Ca/P molar ratio of HA was 1.67 (the stoichiometric ratio of HA). The Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra results for porous HA-based scaffolds and synthesized HA showed that no chemical decomposition occurred in the HA-based scaffold fabrication process. The porosity of the scaffold tended to increase when higher concentrations of HCB were added. XRD data show that the HCB was completely degraded from the scaffold material. The cell metabolic activity and morphology of the HA + HCB 30 wt% scaffold enable it to facilitate the attachment of MC3T3E1 cells on its surface. Conclusion HCB 30 wt% is the best concentration to fabricate the scaffold corresponding to the criteria for pores structure, crystallographic properties, chemical decomposition process and cell viability for bone tissue engineering."

Salvianolic acid B (Sal B) has been demonstrated to be a potential chemoprevention agent for several cancers. Herein, we investigated the pharmacological function of Sal B on non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) metastasis. Methods. Two NSCLC cell lines (NCI-H2030 and NCI-H1650) were disposed of by 200 μM Sal B or 10 μM PKM2 agonist TEPP-46. Wound healing and transwell experiments were implemented for analyzing migratory and invasive capacities. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers β-catenin and E-cadherin were measured via western blotting. Cellular bioenergetics were evaluated with glucose uptake, lactate production, enolase activity, cellular ATP levels, as well as seahorse-based oxygen consumption rate (OCR), extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) analysis. Metabolic reprogramming markers PKM2, LDHA, and GLUT1 were detected via western blotting and immunofluorescence. Results. The results showed that Sal B disposal weakened the migration and invasion of NCI-H2030 and NCI-H1650 cells and inactivated the EMT process according to downregulation of β-catenin and upregulation of E-cadherin. Sal B-treated NSCLC cells displayed decreased glucose uptake, lactate production, enolase activity, cellular ATP levels, OCR, and ECAR, indicating a reduction in metabolic reprogramming. Additionally, Sal B downregulated the expression of PKM2, LDHA, and GLUT1. TEPP-46 may reverse the inhibitory effect of Sal B on metastasis as well as metabolic reprogramming. Conclusion. Our findings provide evidence that Sal B enables to weaken NSCLC metastasis through PKM2-independent metabolic reprogramming, which sheds light on the promising therapeutic usage of Sal B in treating NSCLC."

The islamophobic phenomenon increased radically in Poland during the peak of the migration crisis in the second half of 2015, following numerous press articles and columns which provide a background for such prejudice. The right-wing press titles provided space for authors voicing discriminative opinions about (mostly Muslim) refugees and immigrants from the Middle East and Northern Africa. Using a Discourse-Historical Approach (Wodak, Reisigl), the author analysed which predicational and referential strategies are used to designate social actors and where the line of distinction is drawn between the categories of ‘Us’ and ‘Them’ in right-wing press discourse on the migration crisis. The analysis suggests that right-wing publicists distinguish two diff erent subcategories of ‘Them’: a) refugees and immigrants (usually Muslim) and b) the liberal political and media elites. Therefore, the analysed texts could be perceived as examples of ‘conservative islamophobia’, as defi ned by Monika Bobako, in which European Christian identity is the basis for prejudice against Muslims and liberal advocates of multi-culturalism."

In this study, we evaluated the effect of PGV-1 on a highly metastatic breast cancer cell line, the 4T1 cells, as an anti-metastatic and anti-proliferative agent. Methods: Cell viability was evaluated using MTT assay; while cell cycle profile, apoptosis incidence, and ROS intracellular level were determined by flow cytometry. Cell senescence was observed under senescence-associated-β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining assay. The expression of matrixmetalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) was determined using immunoreaction based-ELISA, while other proteins expression were detected using immunoblotting. Results: Curcumin and PGV-1 showed cytotoxic effects on 4T1 cells with IC50 value of 50 and 4 µM, respectively. The cytotoxic activity of PGV-1 was correlated to the induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest and cell senescence. Furthermore, PGV-1 increased the accumulation of intracellular ROS level. We also revealed that PGV-1 bound to several ROS-metabolizing enzymes, including glyoxalase I (GLO1), peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1), N-ribosyldihydronicotinamide: quinone reductase 2 (NQO2), aldo-keto reductase family 1 member c1 (AKR1C1). As an antimetastatic agent, PGV-1 showed less inhibitory effect on cell migration compared to curcumin. However, PGV-1 significantly decreased MMP-9 protein expression in a dose-dependent manner suggesting it still potent to inhibit metastatic cells. Conclusion: Overall, our findings suggest that PGV-1 is potential to be developed as an antiproliferative and anti-metastatic agent."

With the prosperous development of the mobile Internet and the rapid growth of the Internet of Things, various new applications continue to emerge, such as mobile payment, face recognition, wearable devices, driverless, VR/AR, etc. Although the computing power of mobile terminals is getting higher and the traditional cloud computing model has higher computing power, it is often accompanied by higher latency and cannot meet the needs of users. In order to reduce user delay to improve user experience, and at the same time reduce network load to a certain extent, edge computing, as an application of IOT, came into being. In view of the new architecture after dating edge computing, this paper focuses on the task offloading in edge computing, from task migration in multi-user scenarios and edge server resource management expansion, and proposes a multi-agent load balancing distribution based on deep reinforcement learning DTOMALB, a distributed task allocation algorithm, can perform a reasonable offload method for this scenario to improve user experience and balance resource utilization. Simulations show that the algorithm has a certain adaptability compared to the traditional algorithm in the scenario of multi-user single cell, and reduces the complexity of the algorithm compared to the centralized algorithm, and reduces the average response delay of the overall user. And balance the load of each edge computing server, improve the robustness and scalability of the system."

Because the majority of the most common mid-latitude infections display a typical overt clinical picture, this problem has not been paid a proper attention until recently. Recent rise in incidence rate of infectious diseases lacking typical clinical signs observed lately makes it extremely important to consider the problem more closely. It is believed that such trend is due to a whole body of reasons, including impaired sanitary control, increased both internal and external migration flows, refusal of vaccination in case of long-lasting epidemic wellbeing, emergence of atypical bacterial strains of bacteria resulting from irrational antibiotic therapy etc. Viruses constitute the largest group of organisms on our planet accounting for them as the most common causative agent of infectious diseases of unknown etiology. Some estimates obtained by mathematical modeling propose that at least 320,000 types of viruses capable of infecting mammals may exist, most of which have not been described yet. Hence, monitoring circulation of the known viral pathogens, tracing down their spreading and changes in genome nucleotide sequence as well as revealing new types of viruses become important aspects of epidemiological surveillance necessary for timely response to emerging threats, prediction and early detection of outbreaks both in humans and animals. This review summarizes traditional molecular genetics methods for detection of viral pathogens, such as PCR, real-time PCR, Sanger sequencing with pre-cloning, and methods based on the second and third generation sequencing. Therefore, a more detailed overview was provided to diverse methods based on using such technologies because viral infectious agents investigated with high-throughput sequencing (or NGS — Next Generation Sequencing) has been increasingly appreciated as feasible for diagnostics, disease control, molecular epidemiology and infection control. Finally, a special attention was also paid to the approaches used to enrich the viral genetic material in samples containing low amount of pathogen nucleic acids."

Recently, EGpresto, a highly viscous NBCA-based adhesive, has been developed for vascular-occlusion purposes. In this study, we investigated the heat of polymerization of EGpresto and compared the results with those of a low-viscosity NBCA glue. Results show that EGpresto exhibited a lower heat of polymerization (64 ± 7 °C vs. 34 ± 1 °C). This was due to its high viscosity, which resulted in a delayed polymerization time. To investigate the efficacy and safety of EGpresto for intravenous embolization, a 14 d in vivo animal test was conducted using three pigs. Five cc of EGpresto was injected into the epigastric vein of each animal. Complete postoperative vein occlusion was confirmed at 7 and 14 d by ultrasonographic visualization. After the animals were sacrificed, the operated and unoperated veins were exposed, and the injected adhesive was found without migration. During the histology, the injected adhesive was not found in the inner or outer vein walls, and the immune reactions seemed to be the only foreign-body reaction, showing that EGpresto is a non-toxic and safe intravascular embolic agent."

In this study, Pleiotropic anti-aging effects of a decoction Jing Si herbal drink (JS) containing eight Traditional Chinese Medicine based herbs, with known effects against aging related disorders was evaluated. Adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) from 16 week old adult and 24 month old aging WKY rats were evaluated for the age-related changes in stem cell homeostasis. Effects of JS on self-renewal, klotho and Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase expression DNA damage response were determined by immunofluorescence staining. The effects were confirmed in senescence induced human ADMSCs and in addition, the potential of JS to maintain telomere length was evaluated by qPCR analysis in ADMSCs challenged for long term with doxorubicin. Further, the effects of JS on doxorubicin-induced hypertrophic effect and DNA damage in H9c2 cardiac cells; MPP+-induced damages in SH-SY5Y neuron cells were investigated. In addition, effects of JS in maintaining metabolic regulation, in terms of blood glucose regulation in type-II diabetes mice model, and their potential to suppress malignancy in different cancer cells were ascertained. The results show that JS maintains stem cell homeostasis and provides cytoprotection. In addition JS regulates blood glucose metabolism, enhances autophagic clearances in neurons and suppresses cancer growth and migration. The results show that JS acts on multiple targets and provides a cumulative protective effect against various age-associated disorders and therefore it is a candidate pleiotropic agent for healthy aging."

In spite of the recent progress in targeted therapy, most LADC patients eventually expired due to the inevitable recurrence and drug resistance. New complementary agent with evidence-based molecular mechanism is urgently needed. MiR-34a is an important p53 downstream tumor suppressor, which regulates apoptosis, cell-cycle, EMT (epithelial mesenchymal transition), and so forth. Its expression is deficient in many types of cancers including LADC. Here, we show that a Chinese herbal formula JP-1 activates p53/miR-34a axis in A549 human LADC cells (p53 wild-type). Treatment with JP-1 induces p53 and its downstream p21 and BAX proteins as well as the miR-34a, resulting in growth inhibition, colony formation reduction, migration repression, and apoptosis induction. Accordingly, the decreases of miR-34a downstream targets such as CDK6, SIRT1, c-Myc, survivin, Snail, and AXL were observed. Moreover, JP-1 activates AMPKα and reduces mTOR activity, implying its inhibitory effect on the energy-sensitive protein synthesis and cell proliferation signaling. Our results show that JP-1 activates p53/miR-34a tumor suppressor axis and decreases proteins related to proliferation, apoptosis resistance, and metastasis, suggesting its potential as a complementary medicine for LADC treatment."

Based on that knowledge, we decided to investigate the role of TYMS in the modulation of invasive ability in colon cancer cells, where its effect on cancer metastasis has not been studied in detail before. We employed colon cancer cells isolated from different stages of tumor development, cells undergoing EMT, and TYMS overexpressing cells. The elongation ratio, cell migration, invasion assay, and MMP-7 secretion were applied to analyze the cell behavior. Important epithelial and mesenchymal markers characteristic of EMT were examined at the protein level by Western blot assay. Overall, our study showed a correlation between TYMS level and invasion ability in colon cancer cells and, above all, a crucial role of TYMS in the EMT regulation. We postulate that chemotherapeutics that decrease or inhibit TYMS expression could increase the effectiveness of the therapy in patients with colon cancer, especially in the metastatic stage."

However, cisplatin chemoresistance often occurs with the mechanisms being not well clarified, which results in the cancer recurrence and poor survival. Ginsenoside Rg3, isolated from the Chinese Herb Panax Ginseng, is recognized as an anti-cancer agent. Herein, we aimed to reveal whether Ginsenoside Rg3 alleviates cisplatin resistance and sensitizes GC cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis, and draw out the underlying molecular mechanism in cisplatin-resistant GC cells. The lower expression of miR-429 was found in AGSR-CDDP cells; it was also in association with cisplatin-resistance in GC cells and expression of which was restored following Ginsenoside Rg3 treatment. We also demonstrated that miR-429 made a contribution toward chemosensitivity in GC cells partly through SOX2 regulation. SOX2 was found to contribute to developing platinum resistance and was an authentic target for miR-429 in AGSR-CDDP cells. Importantly, enforced expression of SOX2 with a pcDNA3-SOX2 construct lacking the 3′-UTR miRNA binding site diminished the cytotoxic effects of miR-429 in AGSR-CDDP cells. We demonstrated that Ginsenoside Rg3 enhanced chemosensitivity in AGSR-CDDP GC cells, at least in part, through up-regulating miR-429, thereby targeting SOX2 and modulating downstream PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. Ginsenoside Rg3 was also found to regulate apoptosis-related genes via miR-429 in cisplatin-resistant GC cells. Ginsenoside Rg3 treatment significantly suppressed the migration rate of AGSR-CDDP GC cells, while following transfection with anti-miR-429, the anti-migratory effects of Ginsenoside Rg3 was partially abolished. This data suggested that Ginsenoside Rg3 may impede the chemoresistance and migration of GC cells mainly mediated through miR-429. We concluded that miR-429-regulated SOX2 expression was one of the main mechanisms by which Ginsenoside Rg3 dramatically promoted its anticancer effects on cisplatin-resistant GC cells. We also underscored a supporting model in which miR-429 adjusted PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling by regulating SOX2 in cisplatin-resistant GC cells."

By rationally utilizing three combined strategies including selection based on phage display library, d‐retro‐inverso modification, and multiple conjugation of screened peptidomimetic with 4‐arm PEG, the polymer–peptidomimetic conjugate PEG‐tAHP‐DRI (tetra‐(D‐retro‐inverso isomer of AHP‐12) substitued 4‐arm PEG5k) is obtained as the most promising agent with the strongest binding potency (KD = 51.12 × 10−9 m) and excellent pharmacokinetic properties.

However, a comprehensive mechanobiological model to capture these spatiotemporal events and predict the growth and remodeling of an atherosclerotic artery is still lacking. Here, we present a multiscale model of leukocyte TEM and plaque evolution in the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. The approach integrates cellular behaviors via agent-based modeling (ABM) and hemodynamic effects via computational fluid dynamics (CFD). In this computational framework, the ABM implements the diffusion kinetics of key biological proteins, namely Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL), Tissue Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α), Interlukin-10 (IL-10) and Interlukin-1 beta (IL-1β), to predict chemotactic driven leukocyte migration into and within the artery wall. The ABM also considers wall shear stress (WSS) dependent leukocyte TEM and compensatory arterial remodeling obeying Glagov's phenomenon. Interestingly, using fully developed steady blood flow does not result in a representative number of leukocyte TEM as compared to pulsatile flow, whereas passing WSS at peak systole of the pulsatile flow waveform does. Moreover, using the model, we have found leukocyte TEM increases monotonically with decreases in luminal volume. At critical plaque shapes the WSS changes rapidly resulting in sudden increases in leukocyte TEM suggesting lumen volumes that will give rise to rapid plaque growth rates if left untreated. Overall this multi-scale and multi-physics approach appropriately captures and integrates the spatiotemporal events occurring at the cellular level in order to predict leukocyte transmigration and plaque evolution."

Instead of sending the data gathered by each node to the sink as in client/server, MAs migrate to the sensor nodes (SNs) to collect data, thus reducing energy consumption and bandwidth usage. For MAs, to migrate among SNs, an itinerary should be planned before the migration. Many approaches have been proposed to solve the problem of itinerary planning for MAs, but all of these approaches are based on the assumption that MAs visit all SNs. This assumption, however, is inefficient because of the increasing size of the MAs after visiting each node. Also, in case of node(s) failure, as it is often the case in WSNs, the MAs may not be able to migrate among SNs. None of the proposed approaches takes into consideration the problem of fault tolerance. In this paper, we propose multi-mobile agent itinerary planning-based energy and fault aware data aggregation in wireless sensor networks (MAEF) to plan itineraries for MAs. This can be achieved by grouping nodes in clusters and planning itineraries efficiently among cluster heads (CHs) only. What is more, an alternative itinerary is planned in case of node(s) failure. The simulation result clearly shows that our novel approach performs better than the existing ones."

Such processes have been proved to activate the apoptotic intrinsic route, as well as cell cycle arrest. Despite this knowledge, the whole mechanism of action of Casiope'inas is yet to be completely understood. In this work, we implement a systems biology approach based on two pathway analysis tools (Over-Representation Analysis and Causal Network Analysis), to observe changes in some hallmarks of cancer, induced  by this copper-based chemotherapeutic agent in HeLa cell lines. We find that the metabolism of metal ions is exacerbated, as well as cell division processes being globally diminished. We also show that cellular migration and proliferation events are decreased. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms of liver protection are increased in the cell cultures under the actions of Casiope'inas, unlike the case in many other cytotoxic drugs.

Treg lacking Helios are induced by VIP intrasplenically rather than by migration from the thymus. These results confirm the dual role of VIP as an anti-inflammatory and immune tolerance-promoting agent.</p>"

Hst has been shown to possess bioactivity as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, hypolipidemic, vasoprotector, and anticancer agent. This study aimed to identify potential combinations of Hst and the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin (Dox) as co-chemotherapy agents against 4T1 murine metastatic breast cancer cells. Results MTT assay results showed that Hst exhibited cytotoxic effect in 4T1 cells, and its combination with Dox showed a synergistic effect based on the CI value. The combination of Hst and Dox increased G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction. The combination of Hst and Dox inhibited migration and decreased MMP-9 expression in 4T1 cells. Conclusion In conclusion, the results of this study show that Hst has potential as a Dox co-chemotherapy against 4T1 cells by inducing G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. More importantly, Hst reduces Dox-induced migration and decreases MMP-9 expression."

Inhibiting constitutive STAT3 signaling represents a potential therapeutic approach. We used structure-based design to develop a nonpeptide, cell-permeable, small molecule, termed as LLL12, which targets STAT3. LLL12 was found to inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation (tyrosine 705) and induce apoptosis as indicated by the increases of cleaved caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase in various breast, pancreatic, and glioblastoma cancer cell lines expressing elevated levels of STAT3 phosphorylation. LLL12 could also inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation induced by interleukin-6 in MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells. The inhibition of STAT3 by LLL12 was confirmed by the inhibition of STAT3 DNA binding activity and STAT3-dependent transcriptional luciferase activity. Downstream targets of STAT3, cyclin D1, Bcl-2, and survivin were also downregulated by LLL12 at both protein and messenger RNA levels. LLL12 is a potent inhibitor of cell viability, with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations values ranging between 0.16 and 3.09 µM, which are lower than the reported JAK2 inhibitor WP1066 and STAT3 inhibitor S3I-201 in six cancer cell lines expressing elevated levels of STAT3 phosphorylation. In addition, LLL12 inhibits colony formation and cell migration and works synergistically with doxorubicin and gemcitabine. Furthermore, LLL12 demonstrated a potent inhibitory activity on breast and glioblastoma tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. Our results indicate that LLL12 may be a potential therapeutic agent for human cancer cells expressing constitutive STAT3 signaling."

Current treatment strategies aimed at treating the consequences of coronary artery disease have embraced both optimal medical therapy and catheter based percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents (DES). Current-generation DES elute predominantly mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, which act primarily as a cytostatic agent that retards vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration; this occurs in response to injury and thus prevents restenosis. While DES have reduced restenosis, the use of first-generation DES was associated with an increased risk of late stent thrombosis and accelerated neointimal atherosclerosis (i.e. neoatherosclerosis), both major contributors to late stent failure. The underlying substrate of late DES failure is likely related to vascular endothelial dysfunction, which occurs after DES implantation. Initial concerns with first-generation DES have led to improvements in stent design, polymer load and biocompatibility, and pharmacologic agents, all of which have helped to improve healing responses, lessen late stent failure, and result in an overall improved safety profile. The armamentarium of DES has expanded from the current-generation durable polymer DES to bioresorbable polymer DES, polymer-free DES, and lastly totally bioresorbable vascular scaffolds with a goal of improving vascular responses and endothelial function while preserving anti-restenotic efficacy. We will review these contemporary DES in relation to their short and long-term effects on vascular biocompatibility and healing responses."

Here we present an agent-based model for simulating the emergence of the main biologic patterns found in melanocytic proliferations. Our model portrays the extracellular matrix of the dermo-epidermal junction as a two-dimensional manifold and we simulate cellular migration in terms of geometric translations driven by adhesive, repulsive and random forces. Abstracted cellular functions and melanocyte-matrix interactions are modeled as stochastic events. For identification and validation we use visual renderings of simulated cell populations in a horizontal perspective that reproduce growth patterns observed in vivo by sequential dermatoscopy and corresponding vertical views that reproduce the arrangement of melanocytes observed in histopathologic sections. Our results show that a balanced interplay of proliferation and migration produces the typical reticular pattern of nevi, whereas the globular pattern involves additional cellular mechanisms. We further demonstrate that slight variations in the three basic cellular properties proliferation, migration, and adhesion are sufficient to produce a large variety of morphological appearances of nevi. We anticipate our model to be a starting point for the reproduction of more complex scenarios that will help to establish functional connections between abstracted microscopic behavior and macroscopic patterns in all types of melanocytic proliferations including melanoma."

These new blood vessels allow tumors to continue to grow beyond what the pre-existing vasculature could support. Here, we construct a mathematical model to simulate tumor angiogenesis by considering each endothelial cell as an agent, and allowing the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nutrient fields to impact the dynamics and phenotypic transitions of each tumor and endothelial cell. The phenotypes of the endothelial cells (i.e., tip, stalk, and phalanx cells) are selected by the local VEGF field, and govern the migration and growth of vessel sprouts at the cellular level. Over time, these vessels grow and migrate to the tumor, forming anastomotic loops to supply nutrients, while interacting with the tumor through mechanical forces and the consumption of VEGF. The model is able to capture collapsing and breaking of vessels caused by tumor-endothelial cell interactions. This is accomplished through modeling the physical interaction between the vasculature and the tumor, resulting in vessel occlusion and tumor heterogeneity over time due to the stages of response in angiogenesis. Key parameters are identified through a sensitivity analysis based on the Sobol method, establishing which parameters should be the focus of subsequent experimental efforts. During the avascular phase (i.e., before angiogenesis is triggered), the nutrient consumption rate, followed by the rate of nutrient diffusion, yield the greatest influence on the number and distribution of tumor cells. Similarly, the consumption and diffusion of VEGF yield the greatest influence on the endothelial and tumor cell numbers during angiogenesis. In summary, we present a hybrid mathematical approach that characterizes vascular changes via an agent-based model, while treating nutrient and VEGF changes through a continuum model. The model describes the physical interaction between a tumor and the surrounding blood vessels, explicitly allowing the forces of the growing tumor to influence the nutrient delivery of the vasculature."

However, the underlying mechanism for AGGF1-mediated therapeutic angiogenesis is unknown. Here, we show for the first time that AGGF1 activates autophagy, a housekeeping catabolic cellular process, in endothelial cells (ECs), HL1, H9C2, and vascular smooth muscle cells. Studies with Atg5 small interfering RNA (siRNA) and the autophagy inhibitors bafilomycin A1 (Baf) and chloroquine demonstrate that autophagy is required for AGGF1-mediated EC proliferation, migration, capillary tube formation, and aortic ring-based angiogenesis. Aggf1+/- knockout (KO) mice show reduced autophagy, which was associated with inhibition of angiogenesis, larger infarct areas, and contractile dysfunction after MI. Protein therapy with AGGF1 leads to robust recovery of myocardial function and contraction with increased survival, increased ejection fraction, reduction of infarct areas, and inhibition of cardiac apoptosis and fibrosis by promoting therapeutic angiogenesis in mice with MI. Inhibition of autophagy in mice by bafilomycin A1 or in Becn1+/- and Atg5 KO mice eliminates AGGF1-mediated angiogenesis and therapeutic actions, indicating that autophagy acts upstream of and is essential for angiogenesis. Mechanistically, AGGF1 initiates autophagy by activating JNK, which leads to activation of Vps34 lipid kinase and the assembly of Becn1-Vps34-Atg14 complex involved in the initiation of autophagy. Our data demonstrate that (1) autophagy is essential for effective therapeutic angiogenesis to treat CAD and MI; (2) AGGF1 is critical to induction of autophagy; and (3) AGGF1 is a novel agent for treatment of CAD and MI.

However, the response to chemotherapy is absolutely unsatisfactory and the prognosis of pancreatic cancer remains very poor. Therefore, it would be greatly beneficial to develop therapeutic approaches that cause pancreatic cancer cells to increase their sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine. Forskolin is a natural cAMP elevating agent used for centuries in traditional medicine and its safety has been also documented in modern medicine. Notably, forskolin is emerging as a very interesting molecule to possibly use in cancer therapy. In the present study, we investigated the effects of forskolin on the proliferation, migration and sensitivity to gemcitabine of pancreatic cancer cells, carrying out flow cytometry-based assays of cell-cycle progression and cell death, wound-healing and MTT assays, direct cell number counting and immunoblotting experiments. Here, we show that forskolin exerts significant growth and migratory inhibitory effects on Panc-1 and AsPC-1 pancreatic cancer cells. In addition, we report that forskolin strongly enhances gemcitabine-induced antiproliferative effects by both cell cycle inhibition and cell death induction. Importantly, the forskolin-induced potentiation of antiproliferative effect by gemcitabine is preceded and accompanied by a strong inhibition of phosphorylation levels of Stat3 and Erk1/2 proteins. Altogether, our data enforce the evidence of forskolin acting as a compound with anticancer activity and provide a rationale for the design of in vivo/clinical studies exploring forskolin as a gemcitabine sensitizer/adjuvant to possibly use in pancreatic cancer patients."

In traditional discrete models of motile cells with volume exclusion such a move would be aborted. We introduce a new shoving mechanism which allows cells to choose the direction to shove cells that expends the least amount of shoving effort (to account for the likely resistance of cells to being pushed). We call this motility rule 'smart shoving'. We examine whether agent-based simulations of different shoving mechanisms can be distinguished on the basis of single realisations and averages over many realisations. We emphasise the difficulty in distinguishing cell mechanisms from cellular automata simulations based on snap-shots of cell distributions, site-occupancy averages and the evolution of the number of cells of each species averaged over many realisations.

Several studies have demonstrated their plethora of biological activities—including anti-cancer activity—in a number of cell lines. <i>Anisosciadium lanatum</i> Boiss. is a perennial aromatic herb. Traditionally, it is an edible safe herb with few studies exploring its importance. The current study aims to investigate the chemical composition of essential oil isolated from <i>Anisosciadium lanatum</i> using GC-MS, as well as report its anti-cancer potential and its mechanistic effect on HepG2 liver cancer cell lines, and conduct molecular docking studies. To achieve this, the essential oil was isolated using a Clevenger apparatus and analyzed using GC-MS. The cell viability of HepG2 liver cancer and normal fibroblast NIH-3T3 cell lines was assessed by MTT cytotoxicity assay. The effects of the essential oil on cell migration and invasion were assessed using wound healing and matrigel assays, respectively. The effect of the essential oil on migration and apoptotic-regulating mRNA and proteins was quantified using quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot techniques, respectively. Finally, computational docking tools were used to analyze in silico binding of major constituents from the essential oil against apoptotic and migration markers. A total of 38 components were identified and quantified. The essential oil demonstrated regulation of cell proliferation and cell viability in HepG2 liver cancer cells at a sub-lethal dose of 10 to 25 μg/mL, and expressed reductions of migration and invasion. The treatment with essential oil indicated mitigation of cancer activity by aborting the mRNA of pro-apoptotic markers such as BCL-2, CASPASE-3, CYP-1A1, and NFκB. The algorithm-based binding studies demonstrated that eucalyptol, nerol, camphor, and linalool have potent binding towards the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2. On the other hand, camphor and eucalyptol showed potent binding towards the pro-apoptotic protein CASPASE-3. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the essential oil isolated from <i>Anisosciadium lanatum</i> to drive alleviation of HepG2 cancer cell progression by modulating apoptotic markers. Our findings suggest that <i>Anisosciadium lanatum</i> could be used as a phytotherapeutic anti-cancer agent, acting through the regulation of apoptotic markers.

Annexin A1 (AnxA1), a glucocorticoid-regulated protein, is effective at inhibiting neutrophil transendothelial migration by binding the formyl peptide receptors (FPRs). We aimed to investigate whether 2ME upregulates the expression of AnxA1 and protects against IR-induced lung damage.Methods: IR-mediated acute lung inflammation was induced by ischemia for 40 min followed by reperfusion for 60 min in an isolated, perfused rat lung model. The rat lungs were randomly treated with vehicle or 2ME, and the functional relevance of AnxA1 was determined using an anti-AnxA1 antibody or BOC2 (a pan-receptor antagonist of the FPR). In vitro, human primary alveolar epithelial cells (HPAECs) and rat neutrophils were pretreated with 2ME and an AnxA1 siRNA or anti-AnxA1 antibody and subjected to hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR).Results: 2ME significantly decreased all lung edema parameters, neutrophil infiltration, oxidative stress, proinflammatory cytokine production, lung cell apoptosis, tight junction protein disruption, and lung tissue injury in the IR-induced acute lung inflammation model. 2ME also increased the expression of the AnxA1 mRNA and protein and suppressed the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). In vitro, 2ME attenuated HR-triggered NF-κB activation and interleukin-8 production in HPAECs, decreased transendothelial migration, tumor necrosis factor-α production, and increased apoptosis in neutrophils exposed to HR. These protective effects of 2ME were significantly abrogated by BOC2, the anti-AnxA1 antibody, or AnxA1 siRNA.Conclusions: 2ME ameliorates IR-induced acute lung inflammation by increasing AnxA1 expression.

	      ","Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a progressive, age-associated disease that is characterized with cartilage destruction, subchondral bone remodeling and inflammation of the synovial membrane. Considering the complications of common treatments of OA, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids, investigating new treatments for this disorder is crucial. Recently, the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) expression in pathogenesis of OA has attracted attention.
Objective: This study aimed to explore the effect of punicic acid (PA) in inhibition of MMPs gene expression in LPS-stimulated Bovine Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (BFLS) as a model of OA.
Methods: In the first stage, the toxicity of PA was measured using MTT assay on BFLS cells. Afterward, the cells were stimulated by LPS (Lipopolysaccharide) and MMPs (Matrix Metalloproteinase) expression level in the BFLS cells were investigated using Real-Time PCR, in vitro Migration and Gelatin Zymography, Western Blot Analysis, ELISA Assay and Invasion Assay.
Results: The results showed that PA significantly decreased MMP-9 expression levels in LPS-stimulated BFLS cells; also, it suppressed migration and invasion of the mentioned cells. However, PA had no significant effect on MMP-1-2-3.

All four of the genotoxic agents studied showed a significant increase (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in the tail length and the number of migration groups compared to the negative control. The number of migration groups did not show a significant variation between the four-genotoxic agents nor within their different concentrations. However, the comparison of the modes did show differences between the genotoxic agents, but not within the concentrations of a same genotoxic agent, which indicated a determined chemical interaction on the DNA.

Hydrocarbons are released from deeply buried and heated source rocks, such as shales with a high organic content. They then migrate upwards through the overlying lithologies. Some hydrocarbon becomes trapped in suitable geological structures that, over a geological timescale, produce viable hydrocarbon reservoirs. This work investigates how intelligent agent models can mimic these complex natural subsurface processes and account for geological uncertainty. Physics-based approaches are commonly used in petroleum system modelling and flow simulation software to identify migration pathways from source rocks to traps. However, the problem with these simulations is that they are computationally demanding, making them infeasible for extensive uncertainty quantification. In this work, we present a novel dynamic screening tool for secondary hydrocarbon migration that relies on agent-based modelling. It is fast and is therefore suitable for uncertainty quantification, before using petroleum system modelling software for a more accurate evaluation of migration scenarios. We first illustrate how interacting but independent agents can mimic the movement of hydrocarbon molecules using a few simple rules by focusing on the main drivers of migration: buoyancy and capillary forces. Then, using a synthetic case study, we validate the usefulness of the agent modelling approach to quantify the impact of geological parameter uncertainty (e.g., fault transmissibility, source rock location, expulsion rate) on potential hydrocarbon accumulations and migrations pathways, an essential task to enable quick de-risking of a likely prospect."

The intelligent nanocapsule is a new way to embed surfactant into polymer, which has the advantage of avoiding invalid loss of surfactant in the capsule. In this paper, nanoscale silicon dioxide was prepared by sol–gel method, Janus silica nanoparticles were synthesized by Pickering emulsion preparation, and a Janus functional particle with targeted migration was obtained by coupling agent modification. The amphiphilic temperature responsive polymer AP-g-PNIPAAM was synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization. The capsule wall prepared in this paper has temperature sensitivity, and Janus functional particles in the core play a targeted role. The oil displacement experiments were carried out on five parallel core models with different grade differences. The results show that when the permeability grade of the parallel combined model rises from 2.05 to 21.57, the oil recovery of Janus intelligent microcapsule dispersion system also increases from 11.16% to 20.75%, with an increase rate of 9.59%.

However, treatment with cisplatin is associated with drug resistance and several adverse side effects such as nephrotoxicity, reduced immunity towards infections and hearing loss. A Combination of cisplatin with other drugs is an approach to overcome drug resistance and reduce toxicity. The combination therapy also results in increased sensitivity of cisplatin towards cancer cells. The mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in the cell, consisting of extracellular signal regulated kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38 kinases, and downstream mediator p90 ribosomal s6 kinase (RSK); is responsible for the regulation of various cellular events including cell survival, cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, cell migration and protein translation. This review article demonstrates the role of MAPK pathway in cisplatin based therapy, illustrates different combination therapy involving cisplatin and also shows the importance of targeting MAPK family, particularly RSK, to achieve increased anticancer effect and overcome drug resistance when combined with cisplatin."

It was recently reported that fucoidan also exerts an antitumor function. Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. The aim of this study was to investigate anti-tumor,apoptosis and anti-metastasis effects of fucoidan in both cell-based assays and mouse xenograft model, as well as to clarify possible role of m-TOR pathway in the protection. Methods In vitro: Different concentrations of fucoidan were given to act on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines A549 and H1650. The effects of fucoidan on cell proliferation were observed by detecting cyclin expression levels, CCK8 and EDU experiments and cloning experiments. The apoptotic level was detected by flow cytometry and the apoptotic protein level was detected by Westernblot. By detecting the expression of adhesion molecules, the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family, and Transwell cell invasion and migration experiment, the effect of fucoidan on cell adhesion, invasion and migration was observed. Meanwhile the effect of fucoidan on angiogenesis was observed by detecting the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In vivo experiment: An animal model of NSCLC cell mouse subcutaneous xenograft tumor was established to analyze the correlation between the consumption of fucoidan and the size and volume of xenograft tumor through gross observation. Through immunohistochemical staining and immunofluorescence double staining, ki67 and cell adhesion molecules (E-cadherin, N-cadherin and CD31) and VEGF-A in the tumor were detected, and the correlation between the amount of fucoidan and the above indexes was analyzed. Results Fucoidan inhibited the proliferation and angiogenesis of NSCLC cells via the mTOR pathway and promoted their apoptosis by increasing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Not only that, fucoidan inhibited NSCLC cell invasion via epithelial–mesenchymal transformation (EMT). The mice fed fucoidan exhibited significant reductions in tumor volumes and weights. These indicators (Ki67, VEGF-A,N-cadherin) were decreased and E-cadherin expression was up-regulated in A549 mice that treated with fucoidan. The results showed that fucoidan inhibited tumor proliferation in vivo by affecting the expression of related proteins. Conclusion Fucoidan conveys antitumor effects and our results represent an ideal therapeutic agent for NSCLC."

CXCR4 binds to its ligand SDF-1 to make an axis involved in the homing property of stem cells. This study aimed to employ WHIM syndrome pathogenesis as an inspirational approach to reinforce cell therapies. Wild type and WHIM-type variants of the CXCR4 gene were chemically synthesized and cloned in the pCDH-513B-1 lentiviral vector. Molecular cloning of the synthetic genes was confirmed by DNA sequencing, and expression of both types of CXCR4 at the protein level was confirmed by western blotting in HEK293T cells. Human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (Ad-MSCs) were isolated, characterized, and subjected to lentiviral transduction with Wild type and WHIM-type variants of CXCR4 . The presence of copGFP-positive MSCs confirmed the high efficiency of transduction. The migration ability of both groups of transduced cells was then assessed by transwell migration assay in the presence or absence of a CXCR4-blocking agent. Our qRT-PCR results showed overexpression of CXCR4 at mRNA level in both groups of transduced MSCs, and expression of WHIM-type CXCR4 was significantly higher than Wild type CXCR4 ( P <0.05). Our results indicated that the migration of genetically modified MSCs expressing WHIM-type CXCR4 had significantly enhanced towards SDF1 in comparison with Wild type CXCR4 ( P <0.05), while it was reduced after treatment with CXCR4 antagonist. These data suggest that overexpression of WHIM-type CXCR4 could lead to enhanced and sustained expression of CXCR4 on human MSCs, which would increase their homing capability; hence it might be an appropriate strategy to improve the efficiency of cell-based therapies."

Chlorogenic acid (CGA), a polyphenol, has several biological activities, including the suppression of liver cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Increased levels or alterations in the function of DNMT1 are associated with the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. However, the CGA-affected DNMT1 expression mediated mechanism is still unclear.MethodsThe human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) HepG2 cells were treated with a positive control drug (5-AZA) or varying doses of CGA. DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) protein levels and other relevant proteins were evaluated using Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Cell-cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry-based PI staining, and cell viability was assessed using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The transwell invasion and wound healing assays were used to evaluate cell migration and invasion. In vivo proliferation of the HCC cells was detected. We investigated the expression of DNMT1, p53, p21, p-ERK, MMP-2, and MMP-9 in tumors using immunohistochemical analysis.ResultsOur results showed that CGA inhibited the proliferation, colony formation, invasion, and metastasis of HepG2 cells both in vitro and in vivo by down-regulating DNMT1 protein expression, which enhanced p53 and p21 activity, and resulting in a significant reduction in cell proliferation and metastasis. Moreover, CGA inactivated ERK1/2 and reduced MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in HepG2 cells.ConclusionsCGA can suppress liver cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis through several pathways.

The expediency of using ABM as a development planning tool areas, including strategic, is shown. A territory-population model developed by the authors is based on the behavior of individual members of artificial society and simulates the processes of mortality, fertility and migration. The creation of new agents (birth of children) in the model is the result of the choice of female agents of reproductive age, and this choice depends on their value system. At the same time the population of agents in this regard is not uniform - agents stick to different reproductive strategies: modern (low fertility), and traditional (high fertility). The migration of agents depends on the difference in the level of per capita income both between different areas within a country and between countries. The migration variants for individual agent depend on it’s social ties. The presented design served as the basis for creating three ABMs: 1) model of reproduction of the population of St. Petersburg; 2) labor migration model from the border areas of China into Russia; 3) model of internal and external migration in the European Union.

The traditional view of salivary glands as accessory digestive structures is changing as their importance as sources of systemically active immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory factors is recognized. Salivary gland involvement in maintenance of whole body homeostasis is regulated by the nervous system and thus constitutes a ""neuroendocrine axis"". The potent anti-inflammatory activities, both <it>in vivo </it>and <it>in vitro</it>, of the tripeptide Phe-Glu-Gly (FEG) are reviewed. FEG is a carboxyl terminal peptide of the prohormone SMR1 identified in the rat submandibular salivary gland, The D-isomeric form (feG) mimics the activity of its L-isomer FEG. Macropharmacologically, feG attenuates the cardiovascular and inflammatory effects of endotoxemia and anaphylaxis, by inhibition of hypotension, leukocyte migration, vascular leak, and disruption of pulmonary function and intestinal motility. Mechanistically, feG affects activated inflammatory cells, especially neutrophils, by regulating integrins and inhibiting intracellular production of reactive oxygen species. Pharmacodynamically, feG is active at low doses (100 μg/kg) and has a long (9-12 hour) biological half life. As a therapeutic agent, feG shows promise in diseases characterized by over exuberant inflammatory responses such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome and other acute inflammatory diseases. Arthritis, sepsis, acute pancreatitis, asthma, acute respiratory inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease, and equine laminitis are potential targets for this promising therapeutic peptide. The term ""Immune Selective Anti-Inflammatory Derivatives"" (ImSAIDs) is proposed for salivary-derived peptides to distinguish this class of agents from corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.</p>"

However, the lack of control over cell behavior represents a major concern regarding the efficacy and the safety of the therapy. Here, we demonstrated that when formulating the biosystem, an adequate selection of osmolarity adjusting agents significantly contributes to the regulation of cell responses. Our data showed that these agents interact in the capsule formation process, influencing the alginate crosslinking degree. Therefore, when selecting inert or electrolyte-based osmolarity adjusting agents to encapsulate D1 multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), alginate microcapsules with differing mechanical properties were obtained. Since mechanical forces acting on cells influence their behavior, contrasting cell responses were observed both, in vitro and in vivo. When employing mannitol as an inert osmolarity adjusting agent, microcapsules presented a more permissive matrix, allowing a tumoral-like behavior. This resulted in the formation of enormous cell-aggregates that presented necrotic cores and protruding peripheral cells, rendering the therapy unpredictable, dysfunctional, and unsafe. Conversely, the use of electrolyte osmolarity adjusting agents, including calcium or sodium, provided the capsule with a suitable crosslinking degree that established a tight control over cell proliferation and enabled an adequate therapeutic regimen in vivo. The crucial impact of these agents was confirmed when gene expression studies reported pivotal divergences not only in proliferative pathways, but also in genes involved in survival, migration, and differentiation. Altogether, our results prove osmolarity adjusting agents as an effective tool to regulate cell behavior and obtain safer and more predictable therapies."

Mechanisms underlying sperm migration are mostly unknown, since in vivo investigations are mostly unfeasible for ethical or practical reasons. By presenting a spatio-temporal model of the mammalian female genital tract combined with agent-based description of sperm motion and interaction as well as parameterizing it with bovine data, we offer an alternative possibility for studying sperm migration in silico. The model incorporates genital tract geometry as well as biophysical principles of sperm motion observed in vitro such as positive rheotaxis and thigmotaxis. This model for sperm migration from vagina to oviducts was successfully tested against in vivo data from literature. We found that physical sperm characteristics such as velocity and directional stability as well as sperm-fluid interactions and wall alignment are critical for success, i.e. sperms reaching the oviducts. Therefore, we propose that these identified sperm parameters should be considered in detail for conditioning sperm in artificial selection procedures since the natural processes are normally bypassed in reproductive in vitro technologies.

However, single-agent taxane therapy is not sufficient to inhibit tumor progression and drug resistance in advanced UC. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)1 signaling has been proposed as a mechanism of PTX resistance, but it is unclear whether this can be overcome by FGFR1 inhibition. The present study investigated whether FGFR1 overexpression contributes to PTX resistance and whether FGFR inhibition can enhance PTX efficacy in UC. The effects of PTX combined with the FGFR inhibitor BGJ398 were evaluated in UC cell lines by flow cytometry; Western blot analysis; cell viability, migration, and colony forming assays; and RNA interference. PTX+BGJ398 induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in UC cells with mesenchymal characteristics was accompanied by downregulation of cyclin D1 protein and upregulation of gamma-histone 2A family member X and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Additionally, PTX+BGJ398 synergistically suppressed UC cell migration and colony formation via regulation of EMT-associated factors, while FGFR1 knockdown enhanced the antitumor effect of PTX. These findings provide a basis for development of effective strategies for overcoming PTX resistance in UC through inhibition of FGFR1 signaling."

In this research we use an agent-based model of human mobility and interaction, based on ethnographic and archaeological data, to explore the impact of ecological risk on human population structure via a reconstructed landscape of habitat suitability. The agent-based model allows us to evaluate the size and location of glacial refugia, the size of the populations occupying them and the degree of genetic relatedness between people occupying these areas. To do this, we model the probability of an agent foraging groups' survival as a function of habitat suitability. The model's simulated ""genomes"" (composed of regionally specific genetic markers) allow us to track long-term trends of inter-regional interaction and mobility. The results agree with previous archaeological studies situating a large glacial refugium spanning southern France and northeastern Spain, but we expand on those studies by demonstrating that higher rates of population growth in this central refugium led to continuous out-migration and therefore genetic homogeneity across Western Europe, with the possible exception of the Italian peninsula. These results concur with material culture data from known archaeological sites dating to the Last Glacial Maximum and make predictions for future ancient DNA studies."

Liver cirrhosis and cancer are a consequence of the abnormal angio-architecture formation of liver and formation of new blood vessels. This angiogenesis is driven by overexpression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (Hif1-α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Apart from this, protein kinase B (Akt) is also impaired in liver cancer. Despite the advancement in conventional treatments, liver cancer remains largely incurable. Nowadays, the use of naturally occurring anticancer agents particularly flavonoids is subject to more attention due to their enhanced physicochemical properties. Therefore, this study underlines the use of a natural anticancer agent taxifolin in the treatment of liver cancer using hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 and Huh7. The aim of our study is to devise a natural and efficient solution for the disease prevalent in Pakistan. The study involved the assessment of binding of ligand taxifolin using molecular docking. The binding of taxifolin with the proteins (Hif1-α, VEGF and Akt) was calculated by docking using Vina and Chimera. Further evaluation was performed by cell viability assay (MTT 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) Assay), colony formation assay, cell migration assay, DNA ladder assay and flow cytometry. To see whether taxifolin directly affected expression levels, analysis of gene expression of Hif1-α, VEGF and Akt was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blotting. In silico docking experiments revealed that these proteins showed favorable docking scores with taxifolin. Treatment with taxifolin resulted in the inhibition of the liver cancer growth and migration, and induced apoptosis in HepG2 and Huh7 cell lines at an inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 0.15 µM and 0.22 µM, respectively. The expression of HIF1-α, VEGF and Akt was significantly reduced in a dose- dependent manner. The inhibitory effect of taxifolin on hepatic cells suggested its chemopreventive and therapeutic potential. The studied compound taxifolin exhibited pronounced pro-apoptotic and hepatoprotective potential. Our study has confirmed the pro-apoptotic potential of taxifolin in liver cancer cell lines and will pave a way to the use of taxifolin as a chemotherapeutic agent after its further validation on the animal models and humans based epidemiological studies."

However, the roles of miR-206 and its related molecular mechanisms in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) are still unclear. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore the effects of miR-206 in OSCC tumorigenesis and development.Methods: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect miR-206 expression in OSCC cell lines and primary tumor tissues. The association of miR-206 expression with clinicopathological factors and prognosis was also analyzed. In addition, the effects of miR-206 on the biological behavior of OSCC cells were investigated. Lastly, the potential regulatory function of miR-206 on K-Ras expression was confirmed.Results: MiR-206 expression was significantly downregulated in OSCC tissue samples and cell lines (both P&lt;0.001). Decreased miR-206 expression was significantly associated with advanced tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage, advanced T classifications (ie, size and/or extent of the primary tumor), positive N classification (ie, spread to regional lymph nodes), and shorter overall survival. In addition, upregulation of miR-206 in Tca8113 cells was able to reduce cell proliferation, invasion, and migration and promote cell apoptosis in vitro. Further, K-Ras was confirmed as a direct target of miR-206 by using luciferase reporter assay.Conclusion: These findings indicate that miR-206 may act as a tumor suppressor in OSCC and could serve as a novel therapeutic agent for miR-based therapy.Keywords: miR-206, oral squamous cell carcinoma, prognosis, proliferation, apoptosis, invasion"

Leukocyte chemotactic migration is required for efficient inflammatory response. Inhibition of leukocyte chemotactic migration to the inflammatory site has been shown to provide therapeutic targets for treating inflammatory diseases. Objective: Our study was designed to discover effective and safe compounds that can inhibit leukocyte chemotactic migration, thus providing possible novel therapeutic strategy for treating inflammatory diseases. Materials and methods: In this study, we used transgenic zebrafish model (Tg:zlyz-EGFP line) to visualize the process of leukocyte chemotactic migration. Then, we used this model to screen the hit compound and evaluate its biological activity on leukocyte chemotactic migration. Furthermore, western blot analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of the hit compound on the AKT or ERK-mediated pathway, which plays an important role in leukocyte chemotactic migration. Results: In this study, using zebrafish-based chemical screening, we identified that the hit compound meisoindigo (25 μM, 50 μM, 75 μM) can significantly inhibit zebrafish leukocyte chemotactic migration in a dose-dependent manner (p = 0.01, p = 0.0006, p < 0.0001). Also, we found that meisoindigo did not affect the process of leukocyte reverse migration (p = 0.43). Furthermore, our results unexpectedly showed that indirubin, the core structure of meisoindigo, had no significant effect on zebrafish leukocyte chemotactic migration (p = 0.6001). Additionally, our results revealed that meisoindigo exerts no effect on the Akt or Erk-mediated signalling pathway.

Conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are prescribed but their long term use is associated with adverse effects. Thus, herbal based medicines are attracting major attraction worldwide as potential therapeutic candidates. Tylophora indica (Burm. f) Merrill is a valuable medicinal plant well known in Ayurvedic practices for its immunomodulatory, anti-oxidant, anti-asthmatic and antirheumatic activities. The present study aimed to elucidate the anti-neuroinflammatory potential of water and hydroalcoholic leaf extracts of micropropagated plants of T. indica using BV-2 microglia activated with lipopolysaccharide as an in vitro model system and development of an efficient reproducible protocol for its in vitro cloning. Non cytotoxic doses of the water and hydroalcoholic extracts (0.2μg/ml and 20μg/ml, respectively) were selected using MTT assay. α-Tubulin, Iba-1 and inflammatory cascade proteins like NFκB, AP1 expression was studied using immunostaining to ascertain the anti-neuroinflammatory potential of these extracts. Further, anti-migratory activity was also analyzed by Wound Scratch Assay. Both extracts effectively attenuated lipopolysaccharide induced microglial activation, migration and the production of nitrite via regulation of the expression of NFκB and AP1 as the possible underlying target molecules. An efficient and reproducible protocol for in vitro cloning of T. indica through multiple shoot proliferation from nodal segments was established on both solid and liquid Murashige and Skoog's (MS) media supplemented with 15μM and 10μM of Benzyl Amino Purine respectively. Regenerated shoots were rooted on both solid and liquid MS media supplemented with Indole-3-butyric acid (5-15μM) and the rooted plantlets were successfully acclimatized and transferred to open field conditions showing 90% survivability. The present study suggests that T. indica may prove to be a potential anti-neuroinflammatory agent and may be further explored as a potential therapeutic candidate for the management of neurodegenerative diseases. Further, the current study will expedite the conservation of T. indica ensuring ample supply of this threatened medicinal plant to fulfill its increasing demand in herbal industry."

Furthermore, the migratory activity of hBM-MSCs, which was highly related to membrane fluidity and cytoskeletal abnormality, decreased significantly after MNPs@SiO<sub>2</sub>(RITC) treatment. These observations indicated that the migratory activity of hBM-MSCs was impaired by MNPs@SiO<sub>2</sub>(RITC) treatment due to changes in stem-cell biophysical properties and related biological functions, highlighting the important mechanisms via which nanoparticles impair migration of hBM-MSCs.

The research is based on the theoretical debates held on the Migration-Development-Nexus and the transnational migration paradigm. According to this paradigm, migrants create transnational social fields that link together their society of origin and destination through multi-stranded relations like the sending of remittance to their families, the creation of businesses and networks or the exchange of ideas and skills. Those elements can thus promote the development in both societies. In order to conduct the research, the article takes two key components into account that are crucial to understand the linkage between migration and development in the Colombian case: a) The armed conflict, that has lead to the forced and voluntary displacement of millions of Colombians as well as the post-conflict settings and their impact in the creation of transnational fields; b) The role that gender affects the situation and condition of migrants, as the Colombian migrant collective is characterized by a high degree of feminization.

The neural progenitor cells of these regions express the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, ErbB-1 or HER1).  EGF, the most important ligand for the EGFR, is a potent mitogenic agent that stimulates proliferation, survival, migration and differentiation into the oligodendrocyte lineage.  Other ErbB receptors also activate several intracellular pathways for oligodendrocyte specification, migration and survival.

The goal of the current study is to analyze the genetic variations of the PUUV strains and possible presence of chimeric and reassortant variants among the PUUV strains circulating in bank vole populations in the Trans-Kama area of the RT. Complete S segment CDS as well as partial M and L segment coding nucleotide sequences were obtained from 40 PUUV-positive bank voles and used for the analysis. We found that all PUUV strains belonged to RUS genetic lineage and clustered in two subclades corresponding to the Western and Eastern Trans-Kama geographic areas. PUUV strains from Western Trans-Kama were related to the previously identified strain from Teteevo in the Pre-Kama area. It can be suggested that the PUUV strains were introduced to the Teteevo area as a result of the bank voles’ migration from Western Trans-Kama. It also appears that physical obstacles, including rivers, could be overcome by migrating rodents under favorable circumstances. Based on results of the comparative and phylogenetic analyses, we propose that bank vole distribution in the Trans-Kama area occurred upstream along the river valleys, and that watersheds could act as barriers for migrations. As a result, the diverged PUUV strains could be formed in closely located populations. In times of extensive bank vole population growth, happening every 3–4 years, some regions of watersheds may become open for contact between individual rodents from neighboring populations, leading to an exchange of the genetic material between divergent PUUV strains."

In the decades before 2006, tools available to quantify growth, dispersal, and survival of juvenile salmon in this complex channel network were limited.Fortunately, thanks to technological advances such as acoustic telemetry and chemical and structural otolith analysis, much has been learned over the past decade about the role of the Delta in the life cycle of juvenile salmon. Here, we review new science between 2006and 2016 that sheds light on how different life stages and runs of juvenile salmon grow, move, and survive in the complex channel network of the Delta. One of the most important advances during the past decade has been the widespread adoption of acoustic telemetry techniques. Use of telemetry has shed light on how survival varies among alternative migration routes and the proportion of fish that use each migration route. Chemical and structural analysis of otoliths has provided insights about when juveniles left their natal river and provided evidence of extended rearing in the brackish or saltwater regions of the Delta. New advancements in genetics now allow individuals captured by trawls to be assigned to specific runs. Detailed information about movement and survival in the Delta has spurred development of agent-based models of juvenile salmon that are coupled to hydrodynamic models. Although much has been learned, knowledge gaps remain about how very small juvenile salmon (fry and parr) use theDelta. Understanding how all life stages of juvenile salmon grow, rear, and survive in the Delta is critical for devising management strategies that support a diversity of life history strategies.</p>"

Copper complexed DSF (DSF-Cu) also possesses anti-tumor and chemosensitizing properties; however, its molecular mechanisms of action remain unclear. Here we investigated malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) suppressive effects of DSF-Cu and the molecular mechanisms involved. DSF-Cu inhibited growth of the murine as well as human MPM cells in part by increasing levels of ubiquitinated proteins. DSF-Cu exposure stimulated apoptosis in MPM cells that involved activation of stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) p38 and JNK1/2, caspase-3, and cleavage of poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase, as well as increased expression of sulfatase 1 and apoptosis transducing CARP-1/CCAR1 protein. Gene-array based analyses revealed that DSF-Cu suppressed cell growth and metastasis-promoting genes including matrix metallopeptidase 3 and 10. DSF inhibited MPM cell growth and survival by upregulating cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip1, IGFBP7, and inhibitors of NF-κB such as ABIN 1 and 2 and Inhibitory κB (IκB)α and β proteins. DSF-Cu promoted cleavage of vimentin, as well as serine-phosphorylation and lysine-63 linked ubiquitination of podoplanin. Administration of 50 mg/kg DSF-Cu by daily i.p injections inhibited growth of murine MPM cell-derived tumors in vivo. Although podoplanin expression often correlates with metastatic disease and poor prognosis, phosphorylation of serines in cytoplasmic domain of podoplanin has recently been shown to interfere with cellular motility and migration signaling. Post-translational modification of podoplanin and cleavage of vimentin by DSF-Cu underscore a metastasis inhibitory property of this agent and together with our in vivo studies underscore its potential as an anti-MPM agent."

Research in skin care and dermatology is constantly looking for new non-invasive solutions, preferably those based on the use of natural certified products, able to accelerate the spontaneous skin repair mechanisms and without altering the skin normal appearance and functionality. The wound healing process in the skin is finely regulated by several factors and orchestrated mechanisms, which modulate the progression and the fitting of different consequent phases, including haemostasis, inflammation, cell proliferation and tissue remodelling. It was previously shown that a patented Triticum vulgare aqueous extract was able to trigger the skin repair process by stimulating new tissue growth and reducing the expression levels of inflammatory mediators, such as IL-6, TNF&alpha;, prostaglandin E2, and nitric oxide.Methods: Scratch assay was performed in Human Dermal Fibroblasts (HDF). The production of fibronectin was measured by gene expression, protein quantification and localization using specific antibodies in HDF. The polymerization of actin was measured using rhodamin-phalloidin in HDF. The epidermal lipid content was estimated in HaCaT (human spontaneously immortalized keratinocytes) using Nile Red staining and the increasing GBA gene expression and activity was demonstrated by RT-PCR and enzymatic activity assay.Results: In the present study, it was demonstrated that the T. vulgare extract enhanced cell migration inducing the synthesis of fibronectin, new actin polymerization and stimulating the expression of the Hyaluronan Synthase 2. Furthermore it improved the restoration of the epidermal barrier stimulating lipid synthesis.Conclusion: In conclusion, we demonstrated that the T. vulgare extract possessed promising potential to be developed as a wound healing promoting agent in skin care and dermatology.Keywords: plant extract, wound healing, skin cell culture, ECM component, epidermal barrier"

The aim was to identify the effect of the TEC content on the dispersion of ChNCs in the PLA matrix and the manufacturing of a functional nanocomposite. The nanocomposite film’s optical properties; microstructure; migration of the additive and nanocomposites’ thermal, mechanical and rheological properties, all influenced by the ChNC dispersion, were studied. The microscopy study confirmed that the dispersion of the ChNCs was improved with the increasing TEC content, and the best dispersion was found in the nanocomposite prepared with 15 wt% TEC. Additionally, the nanocomposite with the highest TEC content (15 wt%) resembled the mechanical properties of commonly used polymers like polyethylene and polypropylene.

A question remains as to what the implications are of different social adaptations to long-term vulnerability of small-scale human societies. A stylized agent-based model is presented that captures small-group decision making on movements and resource use in ancient arid environments. The impact of various assumptions concerning storage, exchange, sharing, and migration on indicators of aggregation and sustainability are explored. Climate variability is found to increase the resilience of population levels at the system level. Variability reduces the time a population stays in one location and can degrade the soils. In addition to climate variability, the long-term population dynamics is mainly driven by the level of storage and the decision rules governing when to migrate and with whom to exchange."

With conventional treatment, the median survival time is typically 3-4 years, although it can be extended to 5-7 years or longer with advanced treatments. Recent research indicated that an increase in osteoclast (OC) activity is often associated withmultiple myeloma (MM) and that a decrease inosteoblast (OB) activity contributesto the osteolytic lesions in MM. Normally, the populations of OCs and OBs are inequilibrium, and an imbalance in this statecontributes to the development of lesions.A multi-scale agent-based multiple myeloma model was developed to simulate the proliferation, migration and death of OBs and OCs. Subsequently, this model was employed to investigate the efficacy of thethree most commonly used drugs for MM treatment under the following two premises: the reduction in the progression of MM and the re-establishment of the equilibrium between OCs and OBs.The simulated results not only demonstrated the capacity of the model to choose optimal combinations of the drugs but also showed that the optimal use of the three drugs can restore the balance between OCs and OBs as well as kill MMs. Furthermore, the drug synergism analysis function of the model revealed that restoring the balance between OBs and OCs can significantly increase the efficacy of drugs against tumor cells."

Results . EEDC treatment (10 µg/mL) suppressed transwell migration and invasion of HSC-3 OSCC cells without cytotoxicity. Decreased levels of matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-7, kalikrein 10, cathepsin V, MMP-2, and cathepsin D were also found in EEDC-treated HSC-3 cells based on human protease array. The anti-invasive effects of EEDC involved the suppression of invadopodia-mediated ECM degradation via inhibition of globular-actin elongation. The anti-invasive effect resulting from disturbance of functional invadopodia formation by EEDC was observed even at a low concentration of 5 µg/mL. The phosphorylation of cortactin involved in functional invadopodia formation was decreased at EEDC concentrations that inhibited invadopodia formation.

In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), αv integrin is a crucial mediator of multicellular clustering and collective movement in vitro; however, its contribution to metastatic spread remains to be addressed. According to the emerging therapeutic concept, dissociation of tumor clusters into single cells could significantly suppress metastasis-seeding ability of carcinomas. This study aimed to investigate the anti-OSCC potential of novel endostatin-derived polypeptide PEP06 as a cluster-dissociating therapeutic agent in vitro. Firstly, we found marked enrichment of αv integrin in collectively invading multicellular clusters in human OSCCs. Our study revealed that metastatic progression of OSCC was associated with augmented immunostaining of αv integrin in cancerous lesions. Following PEP06 treatment, cell clustering on fibronectin, migration, multicellular aggregation, anchorage-independent survival and colony formation of OSCC were significantly inhibited. Moreover, PEP06 suppressed αv integrin/FAK/Src signaling in OSCC cells. PEP06-induced loss of active Src and E-cadherin from cell–cell contacts contributed to diminished collective migration of OSCC in vitro. Overall, these results suggest that PEP06 polypeptide 30 inhibiting αv integrin/FAK/Src signaling and disrupting E-cadherin-based intercellular junctions possesses anti-metastatic potential in OSCC by acting as a cluster-dissociating therapeutic agent.

Collective tissue dynamics-understood as population behaviour arising from the interplay of the constituting discrete cells-can be studied with on- and off-lattice agent-based models. However, classical on-lattice agent-based models, also known as cellular automata, fail to replicate key aspects of collective migration, which is a central instance of collective behaviour in multicellular systems. To overcome drawbacks of classical on-lattice models, we introduce an on-lattice, agent-based modelling class for collective cell migration, which we call biological lattice-gas cellular automaton (BIO-LGCA). The BIO-LGCA is characterised by synchronous time updates, and the explicit consideration of individual cell velocities. While rules in classical cellular automata are typically chosen ad hoc, rules for cell-cell and cell-environment interactions in the BIO-LGCA can also be derived from experimental cell migration data or biophysical laws for individual cell migration. We introduce elementary BIO-LGCA models of fundamental cell interactions, which may be combined in a modular fashion to model complex multicellular phenomena. We exemplify the mathematical mean-field analysis of specific BIO-LGCA models, which allows to explain collective behaviour. The first example predicts the formation of clusters in adhesively interacting cells. The second example is based on a novel BIO-LGCA combining adhesive interactions and alignment. For this model, our analysis clarifies the nature of the recently discovered invasion plasticity of breast cancer cells in heterogeneous environments."

Here, we investigated the effect of melatonin on the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in endometriotic endometrial epithelial cells and explored the pathway that might be involved. Methods This hospital-based study included 60 women of reproductive age using the endometrium for immunohistochemistry, 6 women of reproductive age undergoing bilateral tubal ligation and 6 patients with endometriosis for isolation of endometrial epithelial cells or subsequent analysis, respectively. We examined the expression of Notch1/Numb signaling and EMT markers by immunohistochemistry analysis and western blot analysis, the invasion and migration of endometrial epithelial cells by transwell assays, and the cell proliferation by CCK8 assays. Results Compared with normal endometrium, the endometriotic eutopic endometrium showed increased expression of Notch1, Slug, Snail, and N-cadherin, and decreased expression of E-cadherin and Numb. Melatonin or Notch inhibition by specific inhibitor blocked 17β-estradiol-induced cell proliferation, invasion, migration and EMT-related markers in both normal and endometriotic epithelial cells. Conclusions Our data suggest that aberrant expression of Notch1/Numb signaling and the EMT is present in endometriotic endometrium. Melatonin may block 17β-estradiol-induced migration, invasion and EMT in normal and endometriotic epithelial cells by upregulating Numb expression and decreasing the activity of the Notch signaling pathway."

Non-invasive high resolution imaging is required to track the cells and evaluate clinical relevance after cell transplantation. The hypothesis that MRI can provide in vivo detection and long-term observation of MNCs labeled with manganese contrast-agent was investigated in ischemic rat legs. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The Mn-labeled MNCs were evaluated using 7-tesla high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Intramuscular transplanted Mn-labeled MNCs were visualized with MRI for at least 7 and up to 21 days after transplantation in the ischemic leg. The distribution of Mn-labeled MNCs was similar to that of ¹¹¹In-labeled MNCs measured with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and DiI-dyed MNCs with fluorescence microscopy. In addition, at 1-2 days after transplantation the volume of the site injected with intact Mn-labeled MNCs was significantly larger than that injected with dead MNCs, although the dead Mn-labeled MNCs were also found for approximately 2 weeks in the ischemic legs. The area covered by CD31-positive cells (as a marker of capillary endothelial cells) in the intact Mn-MNCs implanted site at 43 days was significantly larger than that at a site implanted with dead Mn-MNCs. CONCLUSIONS: The present Mn-enhanced MRI method enabled visualization of the transplanted area with a 150-175 µm in-plane spatial resolution and allowed the migration of labeled-MNCs to be observed for long periods in the same subject. After further optimization, MRI-based Mn-enhanced cell-tracking could be a useful technique for evaluation of cell therapy both in research and clinical applications."

However, many patients fail to respond and relapse after this treatments due to the acquisition of chemo-resistance. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel drugs that could reverse the resistant phenotype. Curcumin, the constituent of the spice turmeric has been shown to have anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-proliferative properties in several tumor types. However, use of curcumin has been limited due to its poor bio-absorption. Recently, a novel class of curcumin analogs, based on diarylidenylpiperidones (DAP), has been developed by incorporating a piperidone link to the beta-diketone structure and fluoro substitutions on the phenyl groups. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of H-4073, a parafluorinated variant of DAP, using both in vitro and in vivo head and neck cancer models. Our results demonstrate that H-4073 is a potent anti-tumor agent and it significantly inhibited cell proliferation in all the HNSCC cell lines tested in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, pretreatment of cisplatin-resistant HNSCC cell lines with H-4073 significantly reversed the chemo-resistance as observed by cell viability assay (MTT), apoptosis assay (Annexin V binding) and cleaved caspase-3 (Western blot). H-4073 mediated its anti-tumor effects by inhibiting JAK/STAT3, FAK, Akt and VEGF signaling pathways that play important roles in cell proliferation, migration, survival and angiogenesis. In the SCID mouse xenograft model, H-4073 significantly enhanced the anti-tumor and anti-angiogenesis effects of cisplatin, with no added systemic toxicity. Interestingly, H-4073 inhibited tumor angiogenesis by blocking VEGF production by tumor cells as well as directly inhibiting endothelial cell function. Taken together, our results suggest that H-4073 is a potent anti-tumor agent and it can be used to overcome chemotherapy resistance in HNSCC."

These trips take place in the winter season, when the temperatures in the North fall and food supply drops. White storks, because of their large size, depend on the wind, thermals, and orographic characteristics of the environment in order to minimize their energy expenditure during flight. In particular, the birds adopt a soaring behavior in landscapes where the thermal uplift and orographic updrafts are conducive. By attaining suitable soaring heights, the birds then use the wind characteristics to glide for hundreds of kilometers. It is therefore expected that white storks would prefer landscapes that are characterized by suitable wind and thermal characteristics, which promote the soaring and gliding behaviors. However, these same landscapes are also potential sites for large-scale wind energy generation. In this study, we used the observed data of the white stork movement trajectories to specify a data-driven agent-based model, which simulates flight behavior of the white storks in a dynamic environment. The data on the wind characteristics and thermal uplift are dynamically changed on a daily basis so as to mimic the scenarios that the observed birds experienced during flight. The flight corridors that emerge from the simulated flights are then combined with the predicted surface on the wind energy potential, in order to highlight the potential risk of collision between the migratory white storks and hypothetical wind farms in the locations that are suitable for wind energy developments. This work provides methods that can be adopted to assess the overlap between wind energy potential and migratory corridors of the migration of birds. This can contribute to achieving sustainable trade-offs between wind energy development and conservation of wildlife and, hence, handling the issues of human&ndash;wildlife conflicts."

Its function in breast cancer remains to be fully clarified. The aim of this work was to investigate the prognostic value of ME1 and its possible mechanism in breast cancer.Methods: We evaluated ME1 expression in 220 early breast cancer patients with tissue microarray-based immunohistochemistry and explored the relationships between ME1 expression and clinicopathological features. Survival analyses were further performed to determine its prognostic value. The public database was used to confirm tissue microarray results. Further, cell proliferation, migration, invasion ability and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were examined in breast cancer cells.Results: In breast cancer tissues, high ME1 expression was significantly associated with larger tumor size, higher incidence of lymph node metastasis and higher incidence of lymph-vascular invasion. High ME1 expression significantly correlated with worse recurrence-free survival (RFS), and was an independent prognostic factor for RFS, which was confirmed by mRNA results in the public database. In vitro, upregulation of ME1 by transfecting MCF-7 cells with virus vector remarkably enhanced viability, motility and epithelial&ndash;mesenchymal transition (EMT) and decreased ROS levels, whereas knockdown in MDA-MB-468 cells produced totally opposite effects as expected. When pretreated with oxidizing agent, MCF-7 cells overexpressing ME1 lost its motility, whereas MDA-MB-468 cells with knockdown of ME1 restored its motility when pretreated with antioxidant.Conclusion: To our knowledge, these clinical and experiment works first suggested that ME1 may be a novel biomarker and potential therapeutic target for breast cancer metastasis, and its biological effect is mainly controlled by manipulating ROS.Keywords: malic enzyme 1, breast cancer, prognosis, metastasis, reactive oxygen species"

Daly",A C-Terminal Fragment Of Chlorotoxin Retains Bioactivity And Inhibits Cell Migration,2019,Frontiers in Pharmacology,NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN,"Chlorotoxin was originally isolated from the venom of the Israeli scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus, and has potential as a tumor imaging agent based on its selective binding to tumor cells. Several targets have been suggested for chlorotoxin including voltage-gated chloride channels, and it has been shown to have anti-angiogenic activity and inhibit cell migration. The structure of chlorotoxin is stabilized by four disulfide bonds and contains β-sheet and helical structure. Interestingly, the reduced form has previously been shown to inhibit cell migration to the same extent as the wild type, but structural analysis indicates that the reduced form of the peptide does not maintain the native secondary structure and appears unstructured in solution. This lack of structure suggests that a short stretch of amino acids might be responsible for the bioactivity. To explore this hypothesis, we have synthesized fragments of chlorotoxin without disulfide bonds. As expected for such small peptides, NMR analysis indicated that the peptides were unstructured in solution. However, the peptide corresponding to the eight C-terminal residues inhibited cell migration, in contrast to the other fragments. Our results suggest that the C-terminal region plays a critical role in the bioactivity of chlorotoxin."

When a given trait has a shared genetic basis between the sexes, sexual conflict (antagonism) can arise. This can result in significant individual‐level fitness consequences that might also affect population performance, whilst anthropogenic environmental change can further exacerbate maladaptation in one or both sexes driven by sexual antagonism. Here, we develop a genetically explicit eco‐evolutionary model using an agent‐based framework to explore how a population of a facultatively migratory fish species (brown trout Salmo trutta) adapts to environmental change across a range of intersex genetic correlations for migration propensity, which influence the magnitude of sexual conflict. Our modelled focal trait represents a condition threshold governing whether individuals adopt a resident or anadromous (sea migration) tactic. Anadromy affords potential size‐mediated reproductive advantages to both males and females due to improved feeding opportunities at sea, but these can be undermined by high background marine mortality and survival/growth costs imposed by marine parasites (sea lice). We show that migration tactic frequency for a given set of environmental conditions is strongly influenced by the intersex genetic correlation, such that one sex can be dragged off its optimum more than the other. When this occurred in females in our model, population productivity was substantially reduced, but eco‐evolutionary outcomes were altered by allowing for sneaking behaviour in males. We discuss real‐world implications of our work given that anadromous salmonids are regularly challenged by sea lice infestations, which might act synergistically with other stressors such as climate change or fishing that impact marine performance, driving populations towards residency and potentially reduced resilience."

Exosome therapy is an extension of stem cell therapy, and RNA interference (RNAi)-based therapy is a type of advanced precision therapy. Based on the discovery of chronic wound-related genes in diabetes, we combined exosome therapy and RNAi therapy through an engineering approach for the treatment of diabetic chronic wounds. Methods: We combined exosome therapy and RNAi therapy to establish a precision therapy for diabetes-associated wounds via an engineered exosome approach. Results: First, chronic diabetic wounds express low levels of miR-31-5p compared with nondiabetic wounds, and an miR-31-5p mimic was shown to be effective in promoting the proliferation and migration of three wound-related cell types in vitro. Second, bioinformatics analysis, luciferase reporter assays and western blotting suggested that miR-31-5p promoted angiogenesis, fibrogenesis and reepithelization by inhibiting factor-inhibiting HIF-1 (HIF1AN, also named FIH) and epithelial membrane protein-1 (EMP-1). Third, engineered miR-31 exosomes were generated as a miR-31-5p RNAi therapeutic agent. In vivo, the engineered miR-31 exosomes promoted diabetic wound healing by enhancing angiogenesis, fibrogenesis and reepithelization. Conclusion: Engineered miR-31 exosomes are an ideal disease pathophysiology-initiated RNAi therapeutic agent for diabetic wounds."

In this study, we argue that the key regulator of vessel preservation is cell decision behaviour at bifurcations. At flow-convergent bifurcations where migration paths diverge, cells must finely tune migration along both possible paths if the bifurcation is to persist. Experiments have demonstrated that disrupting the cells' ability to sense shear or the junction forces transmitted between cells impacts the preservation of bifurcations during the remodelling process. However, how these migratory cues integrate during cell decision making remains poorly understood. Therefore, we present the first agent-based model of endothelial cell flow-mediated migration suitable for interrogating the mechanisms behind bifurcation stability. The model simulates flow in a bifurcated vessel network composed of agents representing endothelial cells arranged into a lumen which migrate against flow. Upon approaching a bifurcation where more than one migration path exists, agents refer to a stochastic bifurcation rule which models the decision cells make as a combination of flow-based and collective-based migratory cues. With this rule, cells favour branches with relatively larger shear stress or cell number. We found that cells must integrate both cues nearly equally to maximise bifurcation stability. In simulations with stable bifurcations, we found competitive oscillations between flow and collective cues, and simulations that lost the bifurcation were unable to maintain these oscillations. The competition between these two cues is haemodynamic in origin, and demonstrates that a natural defence against bifurcation loss during remodelling exists: as vessel lumens narrow due to cell efflux, resistance to flow and shear stress increases, attracting new cells to enter and rescue the vessel from regression. Our work provides theoretical insight into the role of junction force transmission has in stabilising vasculature during remodelling and as an emergent mechanism to avoid functional shunting."

For in vitro evaluation, BM cells were extracted from the iliac crests of 13 domestic pigs and then labeled with a T2 contrast agent, Feridex, and/or a fluorescent tissue marker, PKH26. The viability, the proliferation efficiency and the efficacies of Feridex and/or PKH26 labeling were determined. For in vivo validation, the 13 pigs underwent endovascular balloon-mediated intimal damages of the iliofemoral arteries. The labeled or un-labeled BM cells were autotransplanted back to the same pig from which the BM cells were extracted. Approximately three weeks post-cell transplantation, 3.0T T2-weighted MRI was performed to detect Feridex-created signal voids of the transplanted BM cells in the injured iliofemoral arteries, which was confirmed by subsequent histologic correlation.Of the in vitro study, the viability of dual-labeled BM cells was 95-98%. The proliferation efficiencies of dual-labeled BM cells were not significantly different compared to those of non-labeled cells. The efficacies of Feridex- and PKH26 labeling were 90% and 100%, respectively. Of the in vivo study, 3.0T MRI detected the auto-transplanted BM cells migrated to the injured arteries, which was confirmed by histologic examinations.This study demonstrates the capability of using clinical 3.0T MRI to monitor the auto-transplantation of BM cells that migrate to the injured arteries of large animals, which may provide a useful MRI technique to monitor cell-based arterial repair."
