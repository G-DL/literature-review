Tadros","Repurposing of Omarigliptin as a Neuroprotective Agent Based on Docking with A<sub>2A</sub> Adenosine and AChE Receptors, Brain GLP-1 Response and Its Brain/Plasma Concentration Ratio after 28 Days Multiple Doses in Rats Using LC-MS/MS",2021,"The authors in the current work suggested the potential repurposing of omarigliptin (OMR) for neurodegenerative diseases based on three new findings that support the preliminary finding of crossing BBB after a single dose study in the literature. The first finding is the positive results of the docking study with the crystal structures of A<sub>2A</sub> adenosine (A2AAR) and acetylcholine esterase (AChE) receptors. A2AAR is a member of non-dopaminergic GPCR superfamily receptor proteins and has essential role in regulation of glutamate and dopamine release in Parkinson’s disease while AChE plays a major role in Alzheimer’s disease as the primary enzyme responsible for the hydrolytic metabolism of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into choline and acetate. Docking showed that OMR perfectly fits into A2AAR binding pocket forming a distinctive hydrogen bond with Threonine 256. Besides other non-polar interactions inside the pocket suggesting the future of the marketed anti-diabetic drug (that cross BBB) as a potential antiparkinsonian agent while OMR showed perfect fit inside AChE receptor binding site smoothly because of its optimum length and the two fluorine atoms that enables quite lean fitting. Moreover, a computational comparative study of OMR docking, other 12 DPP-4 inhibitors and 11 SGLT-2 inhibitors was carried out. Secondly, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) concentration in rats’ brain tissue was determined by the authors using sandwich GLP-1 ELISA kit bio-analysis to ensure the effect of OMR after the multiple doses’ study. Brain GLP-1 concentration was elevated by 1.9-fold following oral multiple doses of OMR (5 mg/kg/day, p.o. for 28 days) as compared to the control group. The third finding is the enhanced BBB crossing of OMR after 28 days of multiple doses that had been studied using <i>LC</i>-MS/MS method with enhanced liquid–liquid extraction. A modified LC-MS/MS method was established for bioassay of OMR in rats’ plasma (10–3100 ng/mL) and rats’ brain tissue (15–2900 ng/mL) using liquid–liquid extraction. Alogliptin (ALP) was chosen as an internal standard (IS) due to its LogP value of 1.1, which is very close to the LogP of OMR. Extraction of OMR from samples of both rats’ plasma and rats’ brain tissue was effectively achieved with ethyl acetate as the extracting solvent after adding 1N sodium carbonate to enhance the drug migration, while choosing acetonitrile to be the diluent solvent for the IS to effectively decrease any emulsion between the layers in the stated method of extraction. Validation results were all pleasing including good stability studies with bias of value below 20%. Concentration of OMR in rats’ plasma were determined after 2 h of the latest dose from 28 days multiple doses, p.o, 5 mg/kg/day. It was found to be 1295.66 ± 684.63 ng/mL estimated from the bio-analysis regression equation. OMR passed through the BBB following oral administration and exhibited concentration of 543.56 ± 344.15 ng/g in brain tissue, taking in consideration the dilution factor of 10. The brain/plasma concentration ratio of 0.42 (543.56/1295.66) was used to illustrate the penetration power through the BBB after the multiple doses for 28 days. Results showed that OMR passed through the BBB more effectively in the multiple dose study as compared to the previously published single dose study by the authors. Thus, the present study suggests potential repositioning of OMR as antiparkinsonian agent that will be of interest for researchers interested in neurodegenerative diseases.","Pharmaceutical Chemistry Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, The British University in Egypt, El-Sherouk City, Cairo 11837, Egypt; Pharmacology and Toxicology Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ain Shams University, Organization of African Unity Street, Abassia, Cairo 11566, Egypt; Pharmaceutical Chemistry Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, The British University in Egypt, El-Sherouk City, Cairo 11837, Egypt; Pharmaceutical Chemistry Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, The British University in Egypt, El-Sherouk City, Cairo 11837, Egypt; Pharmaceutical Analytical Chemistry Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ain Shams University, Organization of African Unity Street, Abassia, Cairo 11566, Egypt",Molecules

Lesmana, Cleopas Martin Rumende",The Difference in Prevalence of Helicobacter pylori Infection between Chinese and Dayak Ethnics with Dyspepsia Syndrome,2016,"Introduction. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection risk is associated with many factors related to host-agent-environment. Ethnicity is one of the host factors which was the most studied factor overseas. The prevalence of H. pylori infection was found higher in certain ethnic such among Chinese. Based on migration and transmission theory, it was suspected that H. pylori infection was transmitted by people migrating from areas with a high prevalence of infection to the destination area. Chinese in West Borneo are originated from South China region where the prevalence of H. pylori infection is high. It is estimated that there are differences in the prevalence of H. pylori infection among Chinese compared to the native people of West Borneo, the Dayaknese.

Methods. This was a cross-sectional study to determine the differences in the prevalence of H. pylori infection. The study was conducted at St. Antonius General Hospital Pontianak from December 2014 to June 2015 with consecutive sampling method. H. pylori infection prevalence is presented in percentage numbers, while the epidemiological characteristics and endoscopic finding differences among Chinese and Dayaknese were analyzed by bivariate analysis using the chi-square with significance value (p) = 0.05.

Results. From a total of 203 subjects in this study, consisted of 102 Chinese subjects and 101 Dayaknese subjects, the prevalence of H. pylori infection was 40.8%. The prevalence among Chinese is higher than Dayaknese, which is 48.0% and 33.7%, respectively. There is no difference in the epidemiological characteristics and endoscopic findings in both ethnic groups.

Conclusions. The prevalence of H. pylori infection among the Chinese (48.0%) is higher than among Dayaknese (33.7%). There is no difference in the epidemiological characteristics and endoscopic findings among both ethnic groups.","Bagian Penyakit Dalam Rumah Sakit Santo Antonius, Pontianak Indonesia ; Divisi Gastroenterologi, Departemen Ilmu Penyakit Dalam Fakultas Kedokteran Universitas Indonesia/Rumah Sakir dr.

Almost all of the COX2 imaging agents using celecoxib as backbone were chemically modified in the position of N-atom in the sulfonamide group. Herein, a novel COX-2 probe (CCY-5) with high targeting ability and a near-infrared wavelength (achieved by attaching a CY-5 dye on the pyrazole ring of celecoxib using a migration strategy) was evaluated for its ability to probe COX-2 in human cancer cells. CCY-5 is expected to have high binding affinity for COX-2 based on molecular docking and enzyme inhibition assay. Meanwhile, CCY-5 caused stronger fluorescence imaging of COX-2 overexpressing cancer cells (Hela and SCC-9 cells) than that of normal cell lines (RAW 264.7 cells). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treated RAW264.7 cells revealed an enhanced fluorescence as LPS was known to induce COX-2 in these cells. In inhibitory studies, a markedly reduced fluorescence intensity was observed in cancer cells, when they were co-treated with a COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib. Therefore, CCY-5 may be a selective bioimaging agent for cancer cells overexpressing COX-2 and could be useful as a good monitoring candidate for effective diagnosis and therapy in cancer treatment.","Department of Medical Oncology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou 350001, Fujian, China; Department of Pharmacological and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of 10 Houston, Houston, TX 77204, USA; Department of Pharmacological and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of 10 Houston, Houston, TX 77204, USA; Department of Pharmacological and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of 10 Houston, Houston, TX 77204, USA; Department of Pharmacological and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of 10 Houston, Houston, TX 77204, USA; Department of Pharmacological and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of 10 Houston, Houston, TX 77204, USA; Department of Pharmacological and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of 10 Houston, Houston, TX 77204, USA; Department of Pharmacological and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of 10 Houston, Houston, TX 77204, USA; Department of Pharmacological and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of 10 Houston, Houston, TX 77204, USA",Molecules

Consequently, patients may be exposed to risk. There are few diagnoses based on in vitro tests, and there are almost no relevant studies.
Methods:: Authors examined involvement of allergic reaction using the leukocyte migration test (LMT) through multiple standpoints in 43 patients who underwent suspected diagnosis of allergy to ALAs.
Results:: Rate of LMT-positives was 54%, and especially the positive rate of lidocaine hydrochloride preparations was significantly high. In 15 positives to lidocaine hydrochloride preparations, all cases were indicated as positive in a test with drugs containing antiseptic agent, but only 3 cases were indicated as positive in a test with lidocaine hydrochloride alone. In addition, test with paraben was conducted in 4 cases; 2 cases were confirmed as positive. In relevance of histories of drug or food allergies, development rates of ALAs-allergies were the highest in both allergies, and were 35% and 13%, respectively.
Conclusions:: There is a high possibility that these adverse reactions were caused by pseudoallergy to drug. Even by allergic reactions, it was assumed that 80% of them might be caused by antiseptic agents such as paraben. In addition, it was suggested that ALAs, especially lidocaine hydrochloride preparations have high antigenicity (sensitizing property). Furthermore, it was considered that patients with past history of drug or food allergies have a high potential for manifestation of the reactions.","Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Niigata University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences; Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Niigata University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences; Department of Pharmacy, Niitsu Medical Center Hospital; Department of Pharmacy, Brain Disease Center Agano Hospital; Department of Pharmacy, Toyoura Hospital; Department of Internal Medicine, Suibarago Hospital, Niigata; Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuyama University, Hiroshima, Japan.; Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuyama University, Hiroshima, Japan.",Allergology International

Herein, we proposed a facile methodology to prepare a gradient polysulfone-based (PSf) UF membrane with effective antifouling properties via coupling magnetic field-assisted directional migration and in-situ hydrolysis of fluoro-agent during non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS). The effect of GO-Fe3O4 gradient distribution and fluorosilane (FAS) in-situ surface modification on membrane morphology, hydrophilicity, porosity, water flux and antifouling properties have been investigated. Optical microscopy and SEM-EDX observations indicated that hydrophilic GO-Fe3O4 nanofiller could directionally migrate in casting solution and eventually result in gradient distribution in PSf matrix under the magnetic field. In addition, the surface enrichment of GO-Fe3O4 provided reaction sites to anchor low energy FAS via in-situ hydrolysis on the membrane surface and realized dual antifouling mechanism (fouling-resistance and fouling-release), which guaranteed UF membranes with excellent antifouling properties and remarkable long-term stability and reusability. Our study provided a new incentive to the development of high performance UF membranes by coupling magnetic migration and in-situ surface modification.","State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Green Chemistry-Synthesis Technology, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, 310014, China; School of Biological and Chemical Engineering, NingboTech University, Ningbo, 315100, China; School of Biological and Chemical Engineering, NingboTech University, Ningbo, 315100, China; Ningbo Research Institute, Zhejiang University, Ningbo, 315100, China; Corresponding author.

Controlling oxygen vacancies is required since RRAM uses resistive switching (RS) characteristics by redistributing oxygen ions in oxide, and poor oxygen defect control has been shown to significantly reduce RRAM reliability. Therefore, this study designed an F based RRAM device using fluorine anions rather than oxygen defect for the main agent of RS behavior. We developed the F:TiO2 RRAM material using a novel in situ doping method in ALD and investigated its RS behaviors. The Pt/F:TiO2/Pt device exhibited forming-less bipolar RS and self-rectifying behavior by fluorine anion migration, effectively reducing the sneak current in crossbar array architecture RRAM. The doped fluorine passivated and reduced oxygen related defects in TiO2, confirmed by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. Adopting the F-based RS material by ALD provides a viable candidate for high reliability RRAM.","Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul 03722, South Korea; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul 03722, South Korea; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul 03722, South Korea; Department of Physics and Telecommunication Engineering, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510006, China and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Nuclear Science, Institute of Quantum Matter, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510006, China; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 24341, South Korea; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul 03722, South Korea",APL Materials
6,"Simeone Marino, Denise E. Kirschner",A Multi-Compartment Hybrid Computational Model Predicts Key Roles for Dendritic Cells in Tuberculosis Infection,2016,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a world-wide health problem with approximately 2 billion people infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb, the causative bacterium of TB). The pathologic hallmark of Mtb infection in humans and Non-Human Primates (NHPs) is the formation of spherical structures, primarily in lungs, called granulomas. Infection occurs after inhalation of bacteria into lungs, where resident antigen-presenting cells (APCs), take up bacteria and initiate the immune response to Mtb infection. APCs traffic from the site of infection (lung) to lung-draining lymph nodes (LNs) where they prime T cells to recognize Mtb. These T cells, circulating back through blood, migrate back to lungs to perform their immune effector functions. We have previously developed a hybrid agent-based model (ABM, labeled GranSim) describing in silico immune cell, bacterial (Mtb) and molecular behaviors during tuberculosis infection and recently linked that model to operate across three physiological compartments: lung (infection site where granulomas form), lung draining lymph node (LN, site of generation of adaptive immunity) and blood (a measurable compartment). Granuloma formation and function is captured by a spatio-temporal model (i.e., ABM), while LN and blood compartments represent temporal dynamics of the whole body in response to infection and are captured with ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In order to have a more mechanistic representation of APC trafficking from the lung to the lymph node, and to better capture antigen presentation in a draining LN, this current study incorporates the role of dendritic cells (DCs) in a computational fashion into GranSim. Results: The model was calibrated using experimental data from the lungs and blood of NHPs. The addition of DCs allowed us to investigate in greater detail mechanisms of recruitment, trafficking and antigen presentation and their role in tuberculosis infection. Conclusion: The main conclusion of this study is that early events after Mtb infection are critical to establishing a timely and effective response. Manipulating CD8+ and CD4+ T cell proliferation rates, as well as DC migration early on during infection can determine the difference between bacterial clearance vs. uncontrolled bacterial growth and dissemination.","Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA",Computation

While many experimental studies discussed the role of ECM in individual and collective cell migration, there are still unanswered questions about the impact of nonlocal cell sensing of other cells on the overall shape of tumour aggregation and its migration type. There are also unanswered questions about the migration and spread of tumour that arises at the boundary between different tissues with different collagen fibre orientations. To address these questions, in this study we develop a hybrid multi-scale model that considers the cells as individual entities and ECM as a continuous field. The numerical simulations obtained through this model match experimental observations, confirming that tumour aggregations are not moving if the ECM fibres are distributed randomly, and they only move when the ECM fibres are highly aligned. Moreover, the stationary tumour aggregations can have circular shapes or irregular shapes (with finger-like protrusions), while the moving tumour aggregations have elongate shapes (resembling to clusters, strands or files). We also show that the cell sensing radius impacts tumour shape only when there is a low ratio of fibre to non-fibre ECM components. Finally, we investigate the impact of different ECM fibre orientations corresponding to different tissues, on the overall tumour invasion of these neighbouring tissues.","Division of Mathematics, University of Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom; Department of Integrated Mathematical Oncology, H.

We focus on the laboratory setting where cancer is treated with chemotherapy drugs, and in this case, the effects of the treatment administration hypothesized by biologists are: the absence of migration and proliferation of tumor cells, which are dying; the stimulation of the production of chemical substances (annexin); the migration of leukocytes in the direction of higher concentrations of chemicals. Here, following the physiological hypotheses made by biologists on the phenomena occurring in these experiments, we introduce an agent-based model reproducing the dynamics of two cell populations (agents), i.e., tumor cells and leukocytes living in the microfluidic chip environment. Our model aims at proof of concept, demonstrating that the observations of the biological phenomena can be obtained by the model on the basis of the explicit assumptions made. In this framework, close adherence of the computational model to the biological results, as shown in the section devoted to the first calibration of the model with respect to available observations, is successfully accomplished.","Istituto per le Applicazioni del Calcolo “Mauro Picone” (CNR-IAC), 00185 Rome, Italy; Istituto di Analisi dei Sistemi ed Informatica “Antonio Ruberti” (CNR-IASI), 00185 Rome, Italy",Mathematics

Although transmission is thought to be highly heterogeneous in both space and time, little is known about the patterns and drivers of transmission in groups of houses in endemic settings. We carried out surveys of PCR positivity in children residing in 2-block patches of highly endemic cities of Colombia. We found high levels of heterogeneity in PCR positivity, varying from less than 30% in 8 of the 10 patches to 56 and 96%, with the latter patch containing 22 children simultaneously PCR positive (PCR22) for DEN2. We then used an agent-based model to assess the likely eco-epidemiological context of this observation. Our model, simulating daily dengue dynamics over a 20 year period in a single two block patch, suggests that the observed heterogeneity most likely derived from variation in the density of susceptible people. Two aspects of human adaptive behavior were critical to determining this density: external social relationships favoring viral introduction (by susceptible residents or infectious visitors) and immigration of households from non-endemic areas. External social relationships generating frequent viral introduction constituted a particularly strong constraint on susceptible densities, thereby limiting the potential for explosive outbreaks and dampening the impact of heightened vectorial capacity. Dengue transmission can be highly explosive locally, even in neighborhoods with significant immunity in the human population. Variation among neighborhoods in the density of local social networks and rural-to-urban migration is likely to produce significant fine-scale heterogeneity in dengue dynamics, constraining or amplifying the impacts of changes in mosquito populations and cross immunity between serotypes.",NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN,PLoS ONE
10,"Chien-Sheng Chen, Jiing-Dong Hwang, Chyuan-Der Lu, Ting-Yuan Yeh",Cost-Effective Location Management for Mobile Agents on the Internet,2015,"Many mobile agent system-related services and applications require interacting with a mobile agent by passing messages. However, an agent’s mobility raises several challenges in delivering messages to a mobile agent accurately. Consisting of tracking and message delivery phases, most mobile agent location management schemes create or receive many update messages and interaction messages to ensure the effectiveness of the schemes. In addition to downgrading the overall performance of a mobile agent location management scheme, excessive transmission of messages increases the network load. The migration locality of a mobile agent and the interaction rate between mobile agents significantly affect the performance of a mobile agent location management scheme with respect to location management cost. This work presents a novel Dual Home based Scheme (DHS) that can lower the location management costs in terms of migration locality and interaction rate. While the DHS scheme uniquely adopts dual home location management architecture, a selective update strategy based on that architecture is also designed for cost-effective location management of mobile agents. Moreover, DHS is compared with available schemes based on formulations and simulation experiments from the perspective of location management costs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DHS scheme performs satisfactorily in terms of migration locality and interaction rate.","Department of Information Management, Tainan University of Technology, Tainan 71002, Taiwan; Department of Electronic Engineering, Jin Wen University of Science and Technology, New Taipei City 23154, Taiwan; Department of Finance, Tainan University of Technology, Tainan 71002, Taiwan; Department of Engineering Science, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 70100, Taiwan",Journal of Sensors

Saucerman",Multiscale Coupling of an Agent-Based Model of Tissue Fibrosis and a Logic-Based Model of Intracellular Signaling,2019,"Wound healing and fibrosis following myocardial infarction (MI) is a dynamic process involving many cell types, extracellular matrix (ECM), and inflammatory cues. As both incidence and survival rates for MI increase, management of post-MI recovery and associated complications are an increasingly important focus. Complexity of the wound healing process and the need for improved therapeutics necessitate a better understanding of the biochemical cues that drive fibrosis. To study the progression of cardiac fibrosis across spatial and temporal scales, we developed a novel hybrid multiscale model that couples a logic-based differential equation (LDE) model of the fibroblast intracellular signaling network with an agent-based model (ABM) of multi-cellular tissue remodeling. The ABM computes information about cytokine and growth factor levels in the environment including TGFβ, TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6, which are passed as inputs to the LDE model. The LDE model then computes the network signaling state of individual cardiac fibroblasts within the ABM. Based on the current network state, fibroblasts make decisions regarding cytokine secretion and deposition and degradation of collagen. Simulated fibroblasts respond dynamically to rapidly changing extracellular environments and contribute to spatial heterogeneity in model predicted fibrosis, which is governed by many parameters including cell density, cell migration speeds, and cytokine levels. Verification tests confirmed that predictions of the coupled model and network model alone were consistent in response to constant cytokine inputs and furthermore, a subset of coupled model predictions were validated with in vitro experiments with human cardiac fibroblasts. This multiscale framework for cardiac fibrosis will allow for systematic screening of the effects of molecular perturbations in fibroblast signaling on tissue-scale extracellular matrix composition and organization.","Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, United States; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States; Department of Pharmacology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, United States; Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, United States; Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, United States; Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, United States; Robert M.

Here, we report that low-cytotoxic concentrations of 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, a DNA demethylating agent, prevent in vitro 3D invasiveness of metastatic melanoma cells and reduce lung metastasis formation in vivo. Results We unravelled that this beneficial effect is in part due to MIR-199A2 re-expression by promoter demethylation. Alone, this miR showed an anti-invasive and anti-metastatic effect. Throughout integration of micro-RNA target prediction databases with transcriptomic analysis after 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine treatments, we found that miR-199a-3p downregulates set of genes significantly involved in invasion/migration processes. In addition, analysis of data from melanoma patients showed a stage- and tissue type-dependent modulation of MIR-199A2 expression by DNA methylation. Conclusions Thus, our data suggest that epigenetic- and/or miR-based therapeutic strategies can be relevant to limit metastatic dissemination of melanoma.","FRE no. 3600 CNRS, Epigenetic Targeting of Cancer (ETaC); FRE no. 3600 CNRS, Epigenetic Targeting of Cancer (ETaC); Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, CRCT; Department of Translational Molecular Medicine, John Wayne Cancer Institute, Providence Saint John’s Health Center; Laboratory for Functional Genomics, Fondation Jean Dausset – CEPH; Laboratory for Epigenetics and Environment, Centre National de la Recherche en Génomique Humaine, CEA; Institut de Recherche Pierre Fabre, CRDPF; Laboratory for Epigenetics and Environment, Centre National de la Recherche en Génomique Humaine, CEA; FRE no. 3600 CNRS, Epigenetic Targeting of Cancer (ETaC); Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, CRCT; CNRS-Pierre Fabre USR3388 ETaC; FRE no. 3600 CNRS, Epigenetic Targeting of Cancer (ETaC)",Clinical Epigenetics

It leads to an economic taxation mechanism based on internal prices and reduces a complex problem of optimal long-term exploitation to a sequence of one-year optimization problems. Internal prices obey natural, economic patterns: the increase in resource amount diminishes taxes, and the rise in the number of “fishers” raises taxes. These taxes stimulate cooperative agent behavior. We consider new problems of optimal fishing, taking into account an adaptive migration of the fish population in two regions. To analyze these problems, we use evolutionary ecology models. We propose a paradoxical method to increase the catch yield through the so-called fish “luring” procedure. In this case, a kind of “giveaway” game occurs, where the region with underfishing becomes more attractive for fish and for catches in the future.","Southern Scientific Centre of Russian Academy of Sciences, 344006 Rostov-on-Don, Russia; I.I.

Triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells, non-cancerous MCF-12A breast cells and chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay were used for antiproliferative, antimigratory and antiangiogenic studies. For an in vivo efficacy study, female CBA nude mice with subcutaneously implanted MDA-MB-231 breast tumors were treated with Pd<sub>2</sub>Spm (5 mg/kg/day) or cisplatin (2 mg/kg/day) administered intraperitoneally during 5 consecutive days. Promising selective antiproliferative activity of Pd<sub>2</sub>Spm was observed in MDA-MB-231 cells (IC<sub>50</sub> values of 7.3–8.3 µM), with at least 10-fold lower activity in MCF-12A cells (IC<sub>50</sub> values of 89.5–228.9 µM). Pd<sub>2</sub>Spm inhibited the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells, suppressed angiogenesis in CAM and decreased VEGF secretion from MDA-MB-231 cells with similar potency as cisplatin. Pd<sub>2</sub>Spm-treated mice showed a significant reduction in tumor growth progression, and tumors evidenced a reduction in the Ki-67 proliferation index and number of mitotic figures, as well as increased DNA damage, similar to cisplatin-treated animals. Encouragingly, systemic toxicity (hematotoxicity and weight loss) observed in cisplatin-treated animals was not observed in Pd<sub>2</sub>Spm-treated mice. The present study reports, for the first time, promising cancer selectivity, in vivo antitumor activity towards TNBC and a low systemic toxicity of Pd<sub>2</sub>Spm.

ABSTRACT


Since 2008, an average of twenty million people per year have been displaced by weather events. Climate migration creates a special setting for a duty to rescue. A duty to rescue is a moral rather than legal duty and imposes on a bystander to take an active role in preventing serious harm to someone else. This paper analyzes the idea of expanding a duty to rescue to climate migration. We address who should have the duty and to whom the duty should extend. The paper discusses ways to define and apply the duty to rescue as well as its limitations, arguing that it may take the form of an ethical duty to prepare. 


INTRODUCTION


Climate migration creates a special setting for a duty to rescue. A duty to rescue is a moral rather than legal duty and imposes on a bystander to take an active role in preventing serious harm to someone else. Examples of circumstances range from person-to-person intimate rescue to saving those in poverty, even in distant parts of the world.[1]


Since 2008, an average of twenty million people per year have been displaced by weather events.[2] Circumstances like being thrust from homes under the threat of fire, mudslide, and flooding vary greatly from long-term changes like land becoming too arid for crops or temperatures increasing annually gradually pushing up the number of heat-related deaths, with the area slowly becoming uninhabitable. Imminence in fleeing affects resettling and need for rescue with important implications for how the duty to rescue might apply.


This paper reevaluates the ethical framing of the duty to rescue and, while it is arguably a stretch, applies it to climate migration.  Climate migration has become common and is expected to increase due to rises in sea level, increases in weather events that make areas uninhabitable, and changes to land that preclude farming or other necessary land uses. We argue that a duty to rescue may help highlight who has moral obligations to whom.  Because the problem is so large in scope, we suggest a change in the ethical limits to humans' duty to rescue other humans who are in distress. We imagine an expansion or extension of the duty to rescue to meet some of the basic needs created by climate migration. Yet how it should expand, and how much depend on ethical framing and practical limitations.


l.     Expanding the Geographical Boundaries


Two commonly recognized emergencies, Hurricane Katrina in the case of weather events and the current COVID-19 pandemic, provide a historical and current backdrop to evaluate ethical obligations as more disasters displace people. A significant reassessment of the ethical scope of an obligation to rescue in the case of weather events will be limited by the ability to render aid to those in distress in the case of a planet-wide weather catastrophe. The problems may overwhelm the ability to rescue or the reasonableness of attempting rescue.


The extent of the moral obligation borne by humans to other humans in the case of a weather event has been largely defined by its locality and limited geographic influence. Whether we are imagining the scope of ethical obligation in the case of hurricane, flood, tornado, drought, or wildfire events, the perceived ethical obligation is significantly defined by the limited impact of these weather events on people outside the zone of the weather event's direct impact, yet close to that zone. A hurricane affecting New Orleans will not have immediate impact on the residents of California or even those on the northeast coast of the United States until a later time. Wildfires in the Pacific Northwest do not impair the ability of those in the rest of the country to come forward with assistance. But as climate migration crosses international borders, and climate events occur simultaneously in many regions, a more expansive duty to rescue may provide the ethical impulse to help those who live afar or migrate long distances. 


In this respect, the need for help in the event of widespread climate migration due to global warming is more like a pandemic than a weather event. Its broad impact area diminishes the capability of nearly the entire balance of the human population to help due to those populations' awareness that they will, in short order, have the same need for the same resources, from the same cause. Those living near current flood zones may find their historically safe havens are also a flood zone. Those previously best positioned to rescue may find themselves also needing to relocate. Thus, we may observe the need for new rescuers.


ll.     The Rule of Rescue


The Rule of Rescue as defined by Al Jonsen describes the moral impetus or knee jerk reaction to save identifiable people facing death.[3] A duty to rescue has since been expanded beyond imminent death and beyond the near and identifiable. But there are limitations. For example, by most accounts, the ethical duty tends not to require extreme bodily risk or financial depletion. In comparing Good Samaritans to humanitarians, Scott M. James argues the duty to rescue arises from unique dependence, but the ethical obligation to help strangers through humanitarian aid is of a different nature.[4] The wrongness of failing to help is arguably more egregious when one is in a unique position to help. Like in the tragedy of the commons, where there is no unique positioning, when the global community is called upon to help, each individual in it may feel less obliged to do so. Climate migration falls in between—it requires helping strangers, yet it may move forward without anyone seeing themselves as uniquely positioned to help until those strangers become part of communities, at which time, there may be more moral justification to help a community member in need.


Generally, arguments about Good Samaritans hinge on extraordinary acts, praiseworthy because they are acts of compassion, not obligation. Now all US states have Good Samaritan laws[5] which protect helpers from liability for help gone wrong or for a failure to succeed once engaged in an act of rescue. Extraordinary help as a moral good is thus somewhat encouraged through legal protection, but not imposed. Conversely, jobs like firefighting, search and rescue, and emergency medical care tend to oblige employees to take on risks that would be extraordinary if undertaken by the average bystander, yet they are rendered ordinary rescue as part of the job. Three states, Minnesota, Rhode Island, and Vermont have a broad duty to rescue, adding legal considerations to an otherwise moral conundrum. The laws do not require bystanders to take on risk for the sake of rescuing strangers.[6] The moral duty will require looking beyond law, but it is unclear how the moral duty to rescue should be distributed in the case of climate migration. A bare minimum would prevent taking advantage of newcomers, paying sub-minimum wage, and discriminating against them. Yet such a minimum is hardly rescue.


lll.     An Ethical Rather than Legal Duty


The difficulty in defining the duty to rescue as a legal obligation is that it is difficult to determine the extent of risk a rescuer ought to be required to take. The nature of this ethical duty is also arguably tied to the experiences of both the rescuer and the rescued. There are subjective aspects like what someone perceives as a danger that make it difficult to write enforceable laws requiring rescue. It is one thing to expect a rescuer to step into several inches of relatively warm water to lift a person lying face down in a pond and enable them to breathe. It is something altogether different to expect that rescuer to dive into frigid water and attempt to extricate someone trapped in a submerged automobile. As the legal philosopher H.L.A. Hart observed, it is always easier to define application of the core intention of any rule, whether law or ethical norm. It is more difficult to create legal certainty about how the law applies to what he described as “penumbra circumstances”. In the case of a hurricane, it is easier to define what surplus resources are available in areas geographically remote from the impact of the storm and demand, as a moral obligation, that those nearby but outside the area provide assistance. It is more difficult to obligate people, organizations, or governments to supply a quantity of medication or some number of ventilators to an adjacent community when they expect to imminently need them for their own community.


In the early stages of climate migration, the ethics of extreme weather event assistance, a common application of the duty to rescue, will be useful and appropriate. The rising sea levels first experienced by island nations in the South Pacific[7] will not render those living in other coastal communities, those with greater available “high ground”, unable to supply resources to those in need. But when sea level rise and climate change affect more communities simultaneously, albeit in varying degree, the task of defining what response is ethically obligatory becomes increasingly complicated. Pinpointing the obligations of those communities which are resource rich to those communities which are resource deprived, and of those partly affected to those more severely affected may become necessary.  The limitations of the traditional duty to rescue could expand to meet the needs.


lV.     Contribution to the Problem


Many argue that the duty to rescue may depend on any appropriate claim of those needing rescue. One issue is whether preferential claims among those who can identify the source of the harm should call for a greater duty or whether everyone in need should be approached as like candidates for rescue, shaping the duty as equal across those on the receiving end. As climate change does have human-made causes, there are strong arguments to impose a greater ethical duty on any entity that caused the climate-related problems leading to the mass exodus. While the global north is often implicated in pollution that causes migration, industries like energy, transportation, and agriculture are tied to climate change and associated with significant greenhouse gas emissions.[8] Practices like directing agriculture to less sustainable single crop growth generally made land less farmable. Yet it is difficult to place blame and identify specific causal relationships as most migration is due to many factors. A movement toward greater accountability can be reframed as a greater duty to rescue, a duty to engage in the extraordinary. The fossil fuel industry, for example, should have a larger obligation than the average person. Similarly, some may argue anyone unjustly enriching themselves while contributing to climate change or people who over-consume have an elevated duty to rescue.[9] Climate change lawsuits demonstrate an eagerness to hold governments and corporations accountable, despite difficulty proving causation.


V.     The Most Vulnerable


One ethical dimension of climate migration that remains unexplored is how a duty to rescue applies to vulnerable populations who stand to be left behind or unable to migrate without assistance. Researchers from the Global North working across the Global South are increasingly observing the phenomenon of ethics dumping, where the research ethics of some countries are imposed on research subjects in other countries.[10] In that vein, rescuers should be careful not to impose unwelcome cultural standards or exploit people who are in the process of migrating. There is a gap in discussions reflecting voices that have been left out. The duty to rescue is incomplete without an attempt to understand the ethical experiences of those being rescued. The actual people affected by climate migration who are the least likely to have the means to migrate, or to do so without extreme hardship, should have a voice informing the global community including those in a position to carry out rescue. People who have the means and are young and healthy may easily make decisions to avoid the catastrophic consequences that climate migration brings. However, what about those who are left behind? For example, especially recognizing cultural differences, the homeless community, disabled community, refugees, the elderly community, and women[11] and children may suffer differently and call for more attention. In some parts of the world, human rights are severely constrained. An ethical duty to rescue, with many considerations and variables, may be more justified in the case of those most in need. As climate migration continues and increases significantly, it may be reasonable to ask the local and global community to focus on those least well positioned to migrate successfully. In this context, the use of phenomenology to understand the lived experiences of those migrating, sometimes termed “ethical experiences”, may help flesh out how a duty to rescue takes shape. The discussion of duty and obligation requires an articulation of the ethical experiences (how the local community in need of rescue views the proposed rescue).  Then, the obligation to interpret the duty as ‘one shall not’ or ‘one must’ can be focused on the migrants’ needs rather than the rescuers’ feelings of obligation.[12] A revised theory of the duty to rescue taking into account the asymmetrical experiences of communities involved could ensure that the needs of people whose living situations, gender, ethnicity, age, or race impact their ability to even begin the migration process are considered.


In this discussion, the rescuing is directed toward communities /collectives of persons migrating, whether at once or across a period of time. Often, the climate migrant may not be in a state to articulate the nature of this event when it happens, given its subjective proximity. Yet, when communities are given the space and opportunity to articulate their shared values, the ethical action of rescue derives its meaningfulness from the community rather than the rescuers.  In other words, allowing climate migrants to explain their feelings can add complexity to what some see as a binary receiver-giver (of rescue) dynamic.


This is necessary because the concept of vulnerable populations is fraught with problematic assumptions. There have been various definitions and criteria to determine what would constitute vulnerable populations.[13] For example, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change[14] identifies and assesses vulnerable populations. These criteria may be helpful. However, they do not provide the full picture. Rather than identifying categorical criteria of vulnerable populations, engaging with people who are experiencing climate migration and listening to their current experiences and concerns helps determine need. Knowing what people need may prevent the kneejerk reaction to label people who are quite resilient yet have appropriate needs “vulnerable”.


Proceeding with caution is important because the duty to rescue has hierarchical underpinnings of ""us"" and ""them."" Often when people swoop in to save, there are good and bad consequences of the intervention. We should proceed with caution because often the helper misses the actual needs of those in need. The only way to combat this would be to make sure that people are empowered to inform those agencies that are able to help. 


In addition to more practical approaches, large scale oral histories could allow those who have migrated already to share their experiences. It would be important to capture the lived experiences of people who are already experiencing the consequences of climate migration or of other migration like that due to political or economic extreme events. These experiences could shape our analysis of whether people in fact wish for rescue. If so, further conversations can determine best actions as well as give important insight into what resources might be necessary to empower people now and in the future. 


Vl.     A Duty to Rescue as a Duty to Prepare


If we view Good Samaritans as going above and beyond, then a duty to rescue, something ethically compelled, must bring rescue out of the framework of charity and place it in the context of humanity and obligations. Such a view would also support expanding the geographical reach of the otherwise more proximate duty. The duty may be stronger and take shape in a more workable way if it applies to preparing places expecting to see an influx of people due to climate migration and to helping those most in need. The duty may arise out of expectations of what type of community the place welcoming those migrating due to climate should be—does it want to offer good housing, schooling, and medical care as well as economic opportunity to new people? And if so, at what cost, or with which risks? If the newcomers are viewed as community members rather than strangers, a model of acceptance may lead to better preparation. Some considerations like whether the actions will reasonably help the persons in need of rescue[15] will shape the application of a duty to rescue in the context of climate migration. Similarly, ensuring that people have the chance to articulate their values may help communities support the newcomers. New relationships should not be defined as migrant and rescuer.


Voluntariness in participation and not forcing any action deemed rescue would help ensure the human rights of those migrating. In the United States, President Biden issued an executive order addressing impending climate migration steeped in a duty to prepare by making plans for resettlement and to address the impact of climate migration.[16]


Vll.     At What Risk?


As we investigate the ethical obligations to meet even basic needs, we must also ask what level of risk is ethically compelled. There is an extraordinary need to integrate newcomers successfully, but it is difficult to stretch an ethical duty to rescue to require all the prerequisites for successful climate migration. Even defining success would create deep ethical arguments. As observed in almost all migrations, extraordinary charitable acts may be the key to success, while an ethical duty to rescue must try to require the important government and community-based basics and ensuring respect for human rights. That is, the migrating people should be rescued from circumstances that contradict basic human rights.


Rather than comparing communities to bystanders, mere places where people will arrive and need to hash out how to find housing, jobs, education, and opportunity, a duty of preparation may be the key to rescue those disenfranchised by migration. There are cultural, personal, physical, psycho-social, and geopolitical issues surrounding how to best help those needing to permanently relocate. Ethics arguments will certainly range from “do nothing”, which may fail people, to “do everything”, which could waste taxpayer money in futile over-preparation while failing to actually help. Communities must avoid planning exclusively for one scenario only to have it not take place. Striking the balance, a duty to rescue as it could apply to climate migration should set goals of societal integration, and providing the basics like education, housing, food, health care, and job opportunity, the precursors to flourishing. Recommending the extraordinary, morally preferred but perhaps not compulsory, when charitable actors are participating, or when wrongdoers are compensating, may be more workable than seeing the duty to rescue as compelling people or local governments to take on significant financial and personal risk for newcomers. While humanitarian ethics supports helping everyone, it is likely that people who resettle in advance of a need to flee will find themselves with more choices and opportunities. Help is warranted for those with more dire needs. Preparing for them may do just that.


Vlll.     Rescue Prior to Migration and Rescue in the Process of Resettlement


The duty to enable the migration in the first-place hints to the inadequacy of a duty to prepare. The traditional duty to rescue perhaps steps in if rescue looks like those geographically just out of harm's way rescuing those in danger. That resembles the traditional moral requirement, or duty to rescue according to the Rule of Rescue. Humanitarian aid typically provided by many institutions makes sense and is in place, although financial support for additional humanitarian aid is always needed. Despite having moved to purportedly more capable communities, migrant communities may be able to develop more egalitarian orders of living.  Rather than continually being identified as having been rescued, it is important to make sure people keep or make social ties during and after migration.  Immigrants often face social isolation.[17] Small shifts in gestural language also have the potential to welcome people and show they are valued. For instance, some migrants may not like questions like “Where are you from?” and “What brings you here?” as they emphasize differences over fitting in.


CONCLUSION


The ethical duty to rescue should be expanded to better match those in need of relocation with a welcome environment and the resources needed to achieve success and fully integrate socially and culturally. Expanding a dialogue that includes the voices of people who have recently migrated whether due to violence, poverty, or climate, could properly frame the extent of the duty. If we are to apply the duty of rescue to climate migration, rescuers should avoid labeling people vulnerable, dependent, or needy, although there is reason to focus on those whose needs are the most dire. A soft duty to rescue people during the course of climate migration can come in the form of preparation. People will need help finding housing, education, access to food, and employment. Ultimately, to help them help themselves may be the best goal. While the obligations should be borne differently by people, whether due to a special responsibility, or a special relationship that creates a clearer duty, the global community must prepare for its role in rescuing those displaced by climate events. By helping those displaced at the start of the climate migration process according to a more commonly held notion of the duty to rescue, and by preparing to incorporate newcomers successfully according to an expanded duty to rescue, effectively a duty to prepare, countries that take on climate refugees may find themselves rewarded by the cultural diversity and workplace talents that people bring. A duty to those at a distance is a reasonable expansion of the duty to rescue. But what one ought to do in the global community varies somewhat from the traditional Rule of Rescue.

To identify factors important in antigenic variation and vlsE recombination, we screened transposon mutants of genes known to be involved in DNA recombination and repair for their effects on infectivity and vlsE recombination. Several mutants, including those in BB0023 (ruvA), BB0022 (ruvB), BB0797 (mutS), and BB0098 (mutS-II), showed reduced infectivity in immunocompetent C3H/HeN mice. Mutants in ruvA and ruvB exhibited greatly reduced rates of vlsE recombination in C3H/HeN mice, as determined by restriction fragment polymorphism (RFLP) screening and DNA sequence analysis. In severe combined immunodeficiency (C3H/scid) mice, the ruvA mutant retained full infectivity; however, all recovered clones retained the 'parental' vlsE sequence, consistent with low rates of vlsE recombination. These results suggest that the reduced infectivity of ruvA and ruvB mutants is the result of ineffective vlsE recombination and underscores the important role that vlsE recombination plays in immune evasion. Based on functional studies in other organisms, the RuvAB complex of B. burgdorferi may promote branch migration of Holliday junctions during vlsE recombination. Our findings are consistent with those in the accompanying article by Dresser et al., and together these studies provide the first examples of trans-acting factors involved in vlsE recombination.",NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN,PLoS Pathogens

The TCP congestion control process is abstracted as a partially observed Markov decision process. In this process, an agent is constructed to interact with the network environment. The agent adjusts the size of the congestion window by observing the characteristics of the network state. The network environment feeds back the reward to the agent, and the agent tries to maximize the expected reward in an episode. We designed a weighted reward function to balance the throughput and delay. Compared with traditional Q-learning, DQN uses double-layer neural networks and experience replay to reduce the oscillation problem that may occur in gradient descent. We implemented the TCP-DQN method and compared it with mainstream congestion control algorithms such as cubic, Highspeed and NewReno. The results show that the throughput of TCP-DQN can reach more than 2 times of the comparison method while the latency is close to the three compared methods.","College of Software, Shenzhen Institute of Information Technology, Shenzhen 518116, China; College of Computer Science and Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an 710049, China; College of Computer Science and Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an 710049, China",Future Internet

Quercetin is a major constituent of various dietary products and recently its anti-cancer potential has been extensively explored, revealing its anti-proliferative effect on different cancer cell lines, both in vitro and in vivo. Quercetin is known to have modulatory effects on cell apoptosis, migration and growth via various signaling pathways. Though, quercetin possesses great medicinal value, its applications as a therapeutic drug are limited. Problems like low oral bioavailability and poor aqueous solubility make quercetin an unreliable candidate for therapeutic purposes. Additionally, the rapid gastrointestinal digestion of quercetin is also a major barrier for its clinical translation. Hence, to overcome these disadvantages quercetin-based nanoformulations are being considered in recent times. Nanoformulations of quercetin have shown promising results in its uptake by the epithelial system as well as enhanced delivery to the target site. Herein we have tried to summarize various methods utilized for nanofabrication of quercetin formulations and for stable and sustained delivery of quercetin. We have also highlighted the various desirable measures for its use as a promising onco-therapeutic agent.","Institute for Skeletal Aging &amp; Orthopedic Surgery, Hallym University-Chuncheon Sacred Heart Hospital, Chuncheon 200704, Korea; Institute for Skeletal Aging &amp; Orthopedic Surgery, Hallym University-Chuncheon Sacred Heart Hospital, Chuncheon 200704, Korea; Institute for Skeletal Aging &amp; Orthopedic Surgery, Hallym University-Chuncheon Sacred Heart Hospital, Chuncheon 200704, Korea; Department of Bio-informatics, School of Computer and Information Sciences, Galgotias University, Greater Noida 203201, India; Institute for Skeletal Aging &amp; Orthopedic Surgery, Hallym University-Chuncheon Sacred Heart Hospital, Chuncheon 200704, Korea; Institute for Skeletal Aging &amp; Orthopedic Surgery, Hallym University-Chuncheon Sacred Heart Hospital, Chuncheon 200704, Korea",Molecules

In the present study, we investigated the impact of helium (He)- or a gas mixture of He and argon (He/Ar)-generated CAPJ on cell proliferation, which is a pivotal step during the wound healing process. With careful treatment duration control, He/Ar-CAPJ effectively induced keratinocyte proliferation and migration mediated through the activation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell cycle progression, which was evidenced by a decrease in E-cadherin levels and increases in N-cadherin, cyclin D1, Ki-67, Cdk2, and p-ERK levels. Rat wound healing studies showed that He/Ar-CAPJ treatment facilitated granulation tissue formation and mitigated inflammation in cutaneous tissue, resulting in accelerated wound closure.

Here, we developed a bladder cancer-on-a-chip (BCOC) to mimic the TME using three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting and microfluidic technology. We fabricated a T24 and a 5637-cell line-based BCOC that also incorporated MRC-5, HUVEC, and THP-1 cells. We evaluated the effects of TME and assessed the immunologic reactions in response to different concentrations of Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) via live/dead assay and THP-1 monocytic migration, and concentrations of growth factors and cytokines. The results show that cell viability was maintained at 15% filling density in circle-shaped cell constructs at 20 μL/min microfluidic flow rate. A 3D co-culture increased the proliferation of BCOCs. We found that the appropriate time to evaluate the viability of BCOC, concentration of cytokines, and migration of monocytes was 6 h, 24 h, and three days after BGC treatment. Lastly, the immunotherapeutic effects of BCOC increased according to BCG dosage. To predict effects of immunotherapeutic agent in bladder cancer, we constructed a 3D bioprinted BCOC model. The BCOC was validated with BCG, which has been proven to be effective in the immunotherapy of bladder cancer.","Department of Urology, Hanil General Hospital, 308 Uicheon-ro, Dobong-gu, Seoul 01450, Korea; School of Mechanical Engineering, College of Engineering, Chung-Ang University, 84 Heukseok-ro, Dongjak-gu, Seoul 06974, Korea; Department of Urology, Chung-Ang University Hospital, Chung-Ang University College of Medicine, 102 Heukseok-ro, Dongjak-gu, Seoul 06973, Korea; Department of Urology, Chung-Ang University Hospital, Chung-Ang University College of Medicine, 102 Heukseok-ro, Dongjak-gu, Seoul 06973, Korea; Department of Urology, Chung-Ang University Hospital, Chung-Ang University College of Medicine, 102 Heukseok-ro, Dongjak-gu, Seoul 06973, Korea; School of Mechanical Engineering, College of Engineering, Chung-Ang University, 84 Heukseok-ro, Dongjak-gu, Seoul 06974, Korea; Department of Urology, Chung-Ang University Hospital, Chung-Ang University College of Medicine, 102 Heukseok-ro, Dongjak-gu, Seoul 06973, Korea",International Journal of Molecular Sciences

Latest researches show that conductive composite materials may make endogenous/exogenous electrical stimulation more effective, guide/comb cell migration to the wound, and subsequently promote wound healing. To accelerate infected wound healing, a novel medical silver nanoparticle-doped conductive polymer-based hydrogel system (Ag NPs/CPH) dressing with good conductivity, biocompatibility, and mechanical and antibacterial properties was fabricated. For the hydrogel dressing, Ag NPs/CPH, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and gelatin were used as the host matrix materials, and phytic acid (PA) was used as the cross-linking agent to introduce conductive polyaniline into the matrix, with antibacterial Ag NPs loaded via impregnation. After a series of analyses, the material containing 5 wt% of PVA by concentration, 1.5 wt% gelatin, 600 μL of AN reactive volume, and 600 μL of PA reactive volume was chosen for Ag NPs/CPH preparation. XPS and FTIR analysis had been further used to characterize the composition of the prepared Ag NPs/CPH. The test on the swelling property showed that the hydrogels had abundant pores with good water absorption (≈140% within 12 h). They can be loaded and continuously release Ag NPs. Thus, the prepared Ag NPs/CPH showed excellent antibacterial property with increasing duration of immersion of Ag NPs. Additionally, to evaluate in vivo safety, CCK-8 experiments of HaCat, LO2 and 293T cells were treated with different concentrations of the Ag NPs/CPH hydrogel soaking solution. The experimental results showed the Ag NPs/CPH had no significant inhibitory effect on any of the cells. Finally, an innovative infection and inflammation model was designed to evaluate the prepared Ag NPs/CPH hydrogel dressing for the treatment of severely infected wounds. The results showed that even when infected with bacteria for long periods of time (more than 20 h), the proposed conductive antibacterial hydrogel could treat severely infected wounds.","Jilin Ginseng Academy, Hospital of Affiliated Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun, China; Jilin Ginseng Academy, Hospital of Affiliated Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun, China; Jilin Ginseng Academy, Hospital of Affiliated Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun, China; Jilin Ginseng Academy, Hospital of Affiliated Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun, China; State Key Laboratory of Supramolecular Structure and Materials, College of Chemistry, Chinese-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Jilin University, Changchun, China; Jilin Ginseng Academy, Hospital of Affiliated Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun, China; Jilin Ginseng Academy, Hospital of Affiliated Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun, China; Jilin Ginseng Academy, Hospital of Affiliated Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun, China; Jilin Ginseng Academy, Hospital of Affiliated Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun, China; Key Laboratory of Songliao Aquatic Environment of Ministry of Education, Jilin Jianzhu University, Changchun, China; Jilin Ginseng Academy, Hospital of Affiliated Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun, China; State Key Laboratory of Supramolecular Structure and Materials, College of Chemistry, Chinese-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Jilin University, Changchun, China",Frontiers in Chemistry

Repeated use of GBCAs causes their deposition in the brain. Such deposition may affect various neuronal cells, including astrocytes. In this study, we examined the effect of GBCAs (Omniscan, Magnescope, Magnevist, and Gadovist) on astrocyte migration, which is critical for formation of neurons during development and maintaining brain homeostasis. All GBCAs increased cell migration and adhesion with increased actin remodelling. Knockdown of integrin αvβ3 by RNAi or exposure to integrin αvβ3 inhibitor reduced astrocyte migration. GBCAs increased phosphorylation of downstream factors of αvβ3, such as FAK, ERK1/2, and Akt. The phosphorylation of all these factors were reduced by RNAi or integrin αvβ3 inhibitor. GBCAs also increased the phosphorylation of their downstream factor, Rac1/cdc42, belonging to the RhoGTPases family. Coexposure to the selective RhoGTPases inhibitors, decreased the effects of GBCAs on cell migration. These findings indicate that GBCAs exert their action via integrin αvβ3 to activate the signaling pathway, resulting in increased astrocyte migration. Thus, the findings of the study suggest that it is important to avoid the repeated use of GBCAs to prevent adverse side effects in the brain, particularly during development.","Research Fellow of Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Department of Integrative Physiology, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine; Department of Diagnostic Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine; Department of Integrative Physiology, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine",Scientific Reports

We postulate that senescence of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), multipotent cells with pro-angiogenic activities, is one of the mechanisms by which systemic inflammation exerts inhibitory effects on angiogenesis in preeclampsia. Methods MSC were isolated from abdominal fat tissue explants removed during medically indicated C-sections from women with preeclampsia (PE-MSC, n = 10) and those with normotensive pregnancies (NP-MSC, n = 12). Sections of the frozen subcutaneous adipose tissue were assessed for inflammation by staining for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1. Viability, proliferation, and migration were compared between PE-MSC vs. NP-MSC. Apoptosis and angiogenesis were assayed before and after treatment with a senolytic agent (1 μM dasatinib) using the IncuCyte S3 Live-Cell Analysis System. Similarly, staining for senescence-associated beta galactosidase (SABG) and qPCR for gene expression of senescence markers, p16 and p21, as well as senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) components, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and PAI-1, were studied before and after treatment with dasatinib and compared between PE and NP. Results After in vitro exposure to TNF-alpha, MSC demonstrated upregulation of SASP components, including interleukins-6 and -8 and MCP-1. Staining of the subcutaneous adipose tissue sections revealed a greater inflammatory response in preeclampsia, based on the higher levels of both TNF-alpha and MCP-1 compared to normotensive pregnancies (p < 0.001 and 0.024, respectively). MSC isolated from PE demonstrated a lower percentage of live MSC cells (p = 0.012), lower proliferation (p = 0.005), and higher migration (p = 0.023). At baseline, PE-MSC demonstrated a senescent phenotype, reflected by more abundant staining for SABG (p < 0.001), upregulation of senescence markers and SASP components, as well as lower angiogenic potential (p < 0.001), compared to NP-MSC. Treatment with dasatinib increased significantly the number of apoptotic PE-MSC compared to NP-MSC (0.011 vs. 0.093) and decreased the gene expression of p16 and six SASP components. The mechanistic link between senescence and impaired angiogenesis in PE was confirmed by improved angiogenic potential of PE-MSC (p < 0.001) after dasatinib treatment. Conclusions Our data suggest that MSC senescence exerts inhibitory effects on angiogenesis in preeclampsia. Senolytic agents may offer the opportunity for mechanism-based therapies.","Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Mayo Clinic; Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Mayo Clinic; Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mayo Clinic; Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mayo Clinic; Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Mayo Clinic; Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Mayo Clinic; Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Mayo Clinic; Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Mayo Clinic; Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Mayo Clinic; Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Mayo Clinic; Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic; Kogod Center of Aging, Mayo Clinic; Kogod Center of Aging, Mayo Clinic; Kogod Center of Aging, Mayo Clinic; Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Mayo Clinic; Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Mayo Clinic",Biology of Sex Differences

(Fam. Menispermaceae), initiates the autophagy-mediated death of human glioblastoma cells by generating reactive oxygen species and activating the autophagy-lysosome pathway. However, its effects on the migration and invasion of human glioblastoma cells have not yet been elucidated. Therefore, human glioblastoma U87 and SF767 cells were treated with SH (0.125 and 0.25 mM) for 24 h, and cell migration and invasion were assessed using scratch wound healing, migration and invasion assays. SH promoted G0/G1 phase arrest, inhibited the migration and invasion of the two cell lines, suppressed the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) and the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/-9, triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, reversed the exogenous epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by the inflammatory microenvironment and the endogenous EMT. Additionally, NFκB p65 overexpression blocked the SH-mediated inhibitory effects on MMP-2/-9 expression and cell invasion. SH-induced autophagy was reduced in CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP) or autophagy-related 5 (ATG5)-silenced human glioblastoma cells and cells treated with 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) or 3-methyladenine (3-MA), as shown by the decreased levels of the microtubule-associated protein light chain 3B (LC3B)-II and autophagic vacuoles (AVs) stained with monodansylcadaverine (MDC), respectively. Moreover, knockdown of CHOP or ATG5 and treatment with 4-PBA or 3-MA abolished the SH-mediated inhibition of mesenchymal markers (vimentin, Snail and Slug) expression and cell invasion, respectively. Importantly, SH also regulated the above related pathways in nude mice. Based on these findings, SH inhibited cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest, and attenuated the metastasis of U87 and SF767 cells by suppressing MMP-2/-9 expression and reversing the endogenous and exogenous EMT in vitro and/or in vivo. Thus, SH might be a new potential anti-metastasis agent for the treatment of human glioblastoma.","Beijing Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Basic Research on Prevention and Treatment of Major Diseases, Experimental Research Center, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100000, China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Basic Research on Prevention and Treatment of Major Diseases, Experimental Research Center, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100000, China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Basic Research on Prevention and Treatment of Major Diseases, Experimental Research Center, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100000, China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Basic Research on Prevention and Treatment of Major Diseases, Experimental Research Center, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100000, China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Basic Research on Prevention and Treatment of Major Diseases, Experimental Research Center, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100000, China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Basic Research on Prevention and Treatment of Major Diseases, Experimental Research Center, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100000, China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Basic Research on Prevention and Treatment of Major Diseases, Experimental Research Center, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100000, China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Basic Research on Prevention and Treatment of Major Diseases, Experimental Research Center, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100000, China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Basic Research on Prevention and Treatment of Major Diseases, Experimental Research Center, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100000, China",International Journal of Molecular Sciences

Knowledge of demographic details such as age, geographical location and sex, will aid in the planning of training and resource allocation to effectively care for the future complex health needs of PLHIV. METHODS: An agent-based, stochastic, geographical model was developed to determine the current and future demographic of PLHIV in Australia. Data and parameters were sourced from Australia's National HIV Registry and peer reviewed literature. Processes that were simulated include progression to AIDS, mortality and internal migration. FINDINGS: The model estimates the mean age of PLHIV in Australia is increasing at a rate of 0.49 years each year. The expected proportion of PLHIV in over 55 years is estimated to increase from 25.3% in 2010 to 44.2% in 2020. Median age is lower in inner-city areas of the capital cities than in rural areas. The areas with the highest prevalence of HIV will continue to be capital cities; however, other areas will have greater percentage growth from 2010 to 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The age of the population of people living with HIV is expected to increase considerably in the future.

However, the best V-0 rating in the UL-94 test was achieved by the incorporation of TAD/EG mixture into the resin matrix. TAD/EG combination exhibited clear synergistic effect on both reducing the flaming intensity and increasing the residual char layer, as confirmed by cone calorimeter tests and TGA results. SEM images combined with XPS analysis revealed that expansion and migration of EG locked the P-containing radicals from decomposing TAD into the condensed phase, which led to the formation of compact and continuous char layers. All the results in our studies demonstrate that incorporation of TAD with a charring agent EG is an effective and promising technique to develop flame-retarded PBT/PET material, which has high potential for applications in the areas of electronic devices, household products, and automotive parts.","Polymer Processing Lab, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Advanced Polymeric Materials, Key Laboratory for Ultrafine Materials of Ministry of Education, School of Materials Science and Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China; Polymer Processing Lab, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Advanced Polymeric Materials, Key Laboratory for Ultrafine Materials of Ministry of Education, School of Materials Science and Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China; Polymer Processing Lab, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Advanced Polymeric Materials, Key Laboratory for Ultrafine Materials of Ministry of Education, School of Materials Science and Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China; Polymer Processing Lab, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Advanced Polymeric Materials, Key Laboratory for Ultrafine Materials of Ministry of Education, School of Materials Science and Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China",Polymers

Although retroviruses may exhibit lymphocytic infiltration into exocrine glands, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) has been postulated to be a causative agent for SS. Transgenic mice with HTLV-1 genes showed sialadenitis resembling SS, but their phenotypic symptoms differed based on the adopted region of HTLV-1 genes. The dominance of <i>tax</i> gene differed in labial salivary glands (LSGs) of SS patients with HTLV 1-associated myelopathy (HAM) and adult T-cell leukemia. Although HTLV-1 was transmitted to salivary gland epithelial cells (SGECs) by a biofilm-like structure, no viral synapse formation was observed. After infection to SGECs derived from SS patients, adhesion molecules and migration factors were time-dependently released from infected SGECs. The frequency of the appearance of autoantibodies including anti-Ro/SS-A, La/SS-B antibodies in SS patients complicated with HAM is unknown; the observation of less frequent ectopic germinal center formation in HTLV-1-seropositive SS patients was a breakthrough. In addition, HTLV-1 infected cells inhibited B-lymphocyte activating factor or C-X-C motif chemokine 13 through direct contact with established follicular dendritic cell-like cells. These findings show that HTLV-1 is directly involved in the pathogenesis of SS.","Division of Hematology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo 173-8610, Japan; Division of Hematology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo 173-8610, Japan; Division of Hematology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo 173-8610, Japan; Division of Hematology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo 173-8610, Japan; Division of Advanced Preventive Medical Sciences, Department of Immunology and Rheumatology, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki 852-8501, Japan; Division of Advanced Preventive Medical Sciences, Department of Immunology and Rheumatology, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki 852-8501, Japan; Division of Hematology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo 173-8610, Japan; Division of Hematology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo 173-8610, Japan",Viruses

However, the CD-100 hydrogel showed moderate in vitro cytotoxicity to mammalian cell lines, with the DA-100 found to be the cytotoxic component. In order to extend the use of the hydrogel to abdominal surgeries, reformulation using a lower oxidized DA (DA-25) was pursued. The aim of the present study was to compare the antimicrobial efficacy, in vitro biocompatibility and wound healing capacity of the highly oxidized CD-100 hydrogel with the CD-25 hydrogel. Antimicrobial studies were performed against a range of clinically relevant abdominal microorganisms using the micro-broth dilution method. Biocompatibility testing using human dermal fibroblasts was assessed via a tetrazolium reduction assay (MTT) and a wound healing model. In contrast to the original DA-100 formulation, DA-25 was found to be non-cytotoxic, and showed no overall impairment of cell migration, with wound closure occurring at 72 h. However, the lower oxidation level negatively affected the antimicrobial efficacy of the hydrogel (CD-25). Although the CD-25 hydrogel’s antimicrobial efficacy and anti-fibroblast activity is decreased when compared to the original CD-100 hydrogel formulation, previous in vivo studies show that the CD-25 hydrogel remains  an effective, biocompatible barrier agent in the prevention of postoperative adhesions.","Department of Microbiology & Immunology, University of Otago, 9054 Dunedin, New Zealand; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, University of Otago, 9054 Dunedin, New Zealand; Department of Chemistry, University of Otago, 9054 Dunedin, New Zealand; Department of Chemistry, University of Otago, 9054 Dunedin, New Zealand; Department of Chemistry, University of Otago, 9054 Dunedin, New Zealand",International Journal of Molecular Sciences
35,"Shangguang Wang, Jinliang Xu, Ning Zhang, Yujiong Liu",A Survey on Service Migration in Mobile Edge Computing,2018,"Mobile edge computing (MEC) provides a promising approach to significantly reduce network operational cost and improve quality of service (QoS) of mobile users by pushing computation resources to the network edges, and enables a scalable Internet of Things (IoT) architecture for time-sensitive applications (e-healthcare, real-time monitoring, and so on.). However, the mobility of mobile users and the limited coverage of edge servers can result in significant network performance degradation, dramatic drop in QoS, and even interruption of ongoing edge services; therefore, it is difficult to ensure service continuity. Service migration has great potential to address the issues, which decides when or where these services are migrated following user mobility and the changes of demand. In this paper, two conceptions similar to service migration, i.e., live migration for data centers and handover in cellular networks, are first discussed. Next, the cutting-edge research efforts on service migration in MEC are reviewed, and a devisal of taxonomy based on various research directions for efficient service migration is presented. Subsequently, a summary of three technologies for hosting services on edge servers, i.e., virtual machine, container, and agent, is provided. At last, open research challenges in service migration are identified and discussed.","State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China; Department of Computing Sciences, Texas A&#x0026;M University at Corpus Christi, Corpus Christi, TX, USA; State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China",IEEE Access

However, it remains elusive whether D-4F and HDL share similar molecular mechanisms underlying anti-atherogenic effects and endothelial cell protections. We here compared the metabolic changes in endothelial cells induced by D-4F and HDL against oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), which may be of benefit to understanding the protective mechanisms of HDL and D-4F. Functional assays, including wound healing, transwell migration, and tube formation, were used to evaluate the pro-angiogenic effects of HDL and D-4F. NMR-based metabolomic analysis was employed to explore the protective mechanisms underlying HDL and D-4F. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was performed to assess metabolic profiles, and orthogonal PLS-DA (OPLS-DA) was carried out to identify characteristic metabolites. Moreover, significantly altered metabolic pathways were also analyzed. We found that ox-LDL impaired the migration and tube formation of endothelial cells. Metabolomic analysis showed that ox-LDL triggered oxidative stress, impaired glycolysis, and enhanced glycerophospholipid metabolism. Both HDL and D-4F improved the migration and angiogenesis of endothelial cells, alleviated oxidative stress, and ameliorated disordered glycolysis impaired by ox-LDL. Strikingly, HDL partially attenuated the disturbed glycerophospholipid metabolism, whereas D-4F did not show this effect. In summary, although D-4F shared the similar protective effects with HDL on the migration and angiogenesis of endothelial cells, it could not deduce the molecular mechanisms of HDL completely. Nevertheless, D-4F possesses the potentiality to be exploited as clinically applicable agent for endothelial cell protection and cardiovascular disease treatment.","Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, MOE Key Laboratory of Spectrochemical Analysis &amp; Instrumentation, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China; Department of Cardiology, The Affiliated Cardiovascular Hospital of Xiamen University, Medical College of Xiamen University, Xiamen, China; Exercise and Health Laboratory, Xiamen University of Technology, Xiamen, China; Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, MOE Key Laboratory of Spectrochemical Analysis &amp; Instrumentation, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China; Department of Cardiology, The Affiliated Cardiovascular Hospital of Xiamen University, Medical College of Xiamen University, Xiamen, China; Department of Cardiology, The Affiliated Cardiovascular Hospital of Xiamen University, Medical College of Xiamen University, Xiamen, China; Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, MOE Key Laboratory of Spectrochemical Analysis &amp; Instrumentation, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China; Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, MOE Key Laboratory of Spectrochemical Analysis &amp; Instrumentation, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China; Department of Cardiology, Fujian Provincial Hospital, Provincial Clinical Medicine College, Fujian Cardiovascular Institute, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease, Fujian Provincial Center for Geriatrics, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China; Department of Ob/Gyn and Neonatal and Reproductive Medicine, The People’s Liberation Army 174th Hospital and The Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, China; Department of Cardiology, The Affiliated Cardiovascular Hospital of Xiamen University, Medical College of Xiamen University, Xiamen, China; Department of Cardiology, Fujian Provincial Hospital, Provincial Clinical Medicine College, Fujian Cardiovascular Institute, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease, Fujian Provincial Center for Geriatrics, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China; Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, MOE Key Laboratory of Spectrochemical Analysis &amp; Instrumentation, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China",Frontiers in Pharmacology

Dysregulation of the receptor for the advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) transmembrane signaling mediates inflammation, resulting in various cancers. However, the mechanism of the RAGE signaling pathway in modulating development of colorectal cancer has not been explored. In this study, an aptamer-based RAGE antagonist (Apt-RAGE) was used to inhibit interaction between RAGE and S100B, thus blocking downstream NFκB-mediated signal transduction. In vitro results showed that Apt-RAGE effectively inhibited S100B-dependent and S100B-independent RAGE/NFκB activation in colorectal HCT116 cancer cells, thus decreasing proliferation and migration of cells. Notably, expression and secretion of VEGF-A were inhibited, implying that Apt-RAGE can be used as an antiangiogenesis agent in tumor therapy. Moreover, Apt-RAGE inhibited tumor growth and microvasculature formation in colorectal tumor-bearing mice. Inhibition of angiogenesis by Apt-RAGE was positively correlated with suppression of the RAGE/NFκB/VEGF-A signaling. The findings of this study show that Apt-RAGE antagonist is a potential therapeutic agent for treatment of colorectal cancer.","College of Biology, Hunan University, Changsha, China; College of Biology, Hunan University, Changsha, China; College of Biology, Hunan University, Changsha, China; CellWay Bio, Changsha, China; CellWay Bio, Changsha, China; College of Biology, Hunan University, Changsha, China",Mediators of Inflammation
39,"James R Caffrey, Barry D Hughes, Joanne M Britto, Kerry A Landman",An in silico agent-based model demonstrates Reelin function in directing lamination of neurons during cortical development.,2014,"The characteristic six-layered appearance of the neocortex arises from the correct positioning of pyramidal neurons during development and alterations in this process can cause intellectual disabilities and developmental delay. Malformations in cortical development arise when neurons either fail to migrate properly from the germinal zones or fail to cease migration in the correct laminar position within the cortical plate. The Reelin signalling pathway is vital for correct neuronal positioning as loss of Reelin leads to a partially inverted cortex. The precise biological function of Reelin remains controversial and debate surrounds its role as a chemoattractant or stop signal for migrating neurons. To investigate this further we developed an in silico agent-based model of cortical layer formation. Using this model we tested four biologically plausible hypotheses for neuron motility and four biologically plausible hypotheses for the loss of neuron motility (conversion from migration). A matrix of 16 combinations of motility and conversion rules was applied against the known structure of mouse cortical layers in the wild-type cortex, the Reelin-null mutant, the Dab1-null mutant and a conditional Dab1 mutant. Using this approach, many combinations of motility and conversion mechanisms can be rejected. For example, the model does not support Reelin acting as a repelling or as a stopping signal. In contrast, the study lends very strong support to the notion that the glycoprotein Reelin acts as a chemoattractant for neurons. Furthermore, the most viable proposition for the conversion mechanism is one in which conversion is affected by a motile neuron sensing in the near vicinity neurons that have already converted. Therefore, this model helps elucidate the function of Reelin during neuronal migration and cortical development.",NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN,PLoS ONE

Methods The study was conducted using three mouse breast cancer models, 4 T1 and E0771 mouse breast cancer cells into their syngeneic hosts, and an MMTV-PyMT transgenic mouse strain was used. Prss14/ST14 knockdown cells were used to test function in tumor growth and metastasis, peptides derived from the autocatalytic loop for activation were tested as preventive metastasis vaccine, and monoclonal and humanized antibodies to the same epitope were tested as new therapeutic candidates. ELISA, immunoprecipitation, Immunofluorescent staining, and flow cytometry were used to examine antigen binding. The functions of antibodies were tested in vitro for cell migration and in vivo for tumor growth and metastasis. Results Prss14/ST14 is critically involved in the metastasis of breast cancer and poor survival rather than primary tumor growth in two mouse models. The epitopes derived from the specific autocatalytic loop region of Prss14/ST14, based on structural modeling acted as efficient preventive metastasis vaccines in mice. A new specific monoclonal antibody mAb3F3 generated against the engineered loop structure could reduce cell migration, eliminate metastasis in PyMT mice, and can detect the Prss14/ST14 protein expressed in various human cancer cells. Humanized antibody huAb3F3 maintained the specificity and reduced the migration of human breast cancer cells in vitro. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that Prss14/ST14 is an important target for modulating metastasis. Our newly developed hybridoma mAbs and humanized antibody can be further developed as new promising candidates for the use in diagnosis and in immunotherapy of human metastatic breast cancer.","Department of Biological Sciences, Inha University; Department of Biological Sciences, Inha University; Division of Life Sciences, Seoul National University; New Drug Development Center, Osong Medical Innovation Foundation; New Drug Development Center, Osong Medical Innovation Foundation; New Drug Development Center, Osong Medical Innovation Foundation; New Drug Development Center, Osong Medical Innovation Foundation; Department of Biological Sciences, Inha University; Department of Biological Sciences, Inha University; Department of Biological Sciences, Inha University; Department of Biological Sciences, Inha University; Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, Sungkyunkwan University, Samsung Medical Center; Department of Life Sciences, Korea University; Department of Biological Sciences, Inha University",Journal of Experimental & Clinical Cancer Research

The synthesized Zn-BTC@CS was characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the obtained data indicated a highly smooth surface morphology of the synthesized Zn-BTC and no morphological changes when the Zn-BTC covered the CS. In addition, the particle size diameter varied from 20 to 40 nm. XRD displayed a well-maintained Zn-BTC structure, and the crystal structure of Zn-BTC was not distorted by the composition of Zn-BTC and chitosan in the nanocomposite. Data from BET analysis revealed that the specific surface area of the Zn-BTC was reduced from 995.15 m<sup>2</sup>/g to 15.16 m<sup>2</sup>/g after coating with chitosan. The pore size distribution and pore volume of the Zn-BTC, Zn-BTC@CS were centered at 37.26 nm and at 22.5 nm, respectively. Zn-BTC@CS exhibited anticancer efficacy against lung and colon cancer cell lines. Zn-BTC@CS inhibited the proliferation of A549 and DLD-1 cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 13.2 and 19.8 µg/mL for the colon and lung cancer cell lines, respectively. Zn-BTC@CS stimulated the apoptotic process through up-regulating P53 expression and down-regulating Bcl-2 expression. Moreover, Zn-BTC@CS induced in vitro DNA fragmentation in both cancer cell lines with significantly different affinity by 66% (A549) and 20% (DLD-1) versus 52% reduction by Cisplatin. Zn-BTC@CS (IC50) exhibited anti-invasive activity and dramatically inhibited the migration of lung and colon cancer cell lines. This study provides evidence that Zn-BTC@CS targets the essential proteins involved in proliferation, metastasis, and apoptosis. Thus, Zn-BTC@CS has chemotherapeutic potential for inhibiting lung and colon cancer viability and growth.","Department of Chemistry, College of Science, King Faisal University, Al-Ahsa 31982, Saudi Arabia; Biological Science Department, College of Science, King Faisal University, Al-Ahsa 31982, Saudi Arabia; Department of Chemistry, College of Science, King Faisal University, Al-Ahsa 31982, Saudi Arabia",Polymers

They are synthesized endogenously in humans, though not fully compensating all body requirements. Consequently, they are considered as partially essential fatty acids. MUFA represent a healthier alternative to saturated animal fats and have several health benefits, including anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer characters. The main body of the abstract This review capitalizes on the major omega-9 pharmacological activities in context of inflammation management for its different natural forms in different dietary sources. The observed anti-inflammatory effects reported for oleic acid (OA), mead acid, and erucic acid were directed to attenuate inflammation in several physiological and pathological conditions such as wound healing and eye inflammation by altering the production of inflammatory mediators, modulating neutrophils infiltration, and altering VEGF effector pathway. OA action mechanisms as anti-tumor agent in different cancer types are compiled for the first time based on its anti- and pro-carcinogenic actions. Conclusion We conclude that several pathways are likely to explain the anti-proliferative activity of OA including suppression of migration and proliferation of breast cancer cells, as well stimulation of tumor suppressor genes. Such action mechanisms warrant for further supportive clinical and epidemiological studies to confirm the beneficial outcomes of omega-9 consumption especially over long-term intervention.","Pharmacognosy Department, College of Pharmacy, Cairo University; Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy & Biotechnology, The German University in Cairo",Journal of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology

Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are small subpopulations of cells with capacities for drug resistance, self-renewal, recurrence, metastasis, and differentiation. Herein, powder extracts of beetroot were subjected to silica gel, gel filtration, thin layer chromatography (TLC), and preparatory high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) for isolation of one compound, based on activity-guided purification using tumorsphere formation assays. The purified compound was identified as betavulgarin, using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry. Betavulgarin suppressed the proliferation, migration, colony formation, and mammosphere formation of breast cancer cells and reduced the size of the CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>−</sup> subpopulation and the expression of the self-renewal-related genes, <i>C-Myc</i>,<i> Nanog</i>, and <i>Oct4</i>. This compound decreased the total level and phosphorylated nuclear level of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) and reduced the mRNA and protein levels of sex determining region Y (SRY)-box 2 (SOX2), in mammospheres. These data suggest that betavulgarin inhibit the Stat3/Sox2 signaling pathway and induces BCSC death, indicating betavulgarin might be an anticancer agent against breast cancer cells and BCSCs.","Interdisciplinary Graduate Program in Advanced Convergence Technology and Science, Jeju National University, Jeju 63243, Korea; Subtropical/Tropical Organism Gene Bank, Jeju National University, Jeju 63243, Korea; Interdisciplinary Graduate Program in Advanced Convergence Technology and Science, Jeju National University, Jeju 63243, Korea; Interdisciplinary Graduate Program in Advanced Convergence Technology and Science, Jeju National University, Jeju 63243, Korea; Interdisciplinary Graduate Program in Advanced Convergence Technology and Science, Jeju National University, Jeju 63243, Korea; Interdisciplinary Graduate Program in Advanced Convergence Technology and Science, Jeju National University, Jeju 63243, Korea; Division of Biotechnology, College of Environmental and Bioresource Sciences, Jeonbuk National University, Gobong-ro 79, Iksan 54596, Korea; Interdisciplinary Graduate Program in Advanced Convergence Technology and Science, Jeju National University, Jeju 63243, Korea",Molecules

By embedding a migration dynamic into Kuran and Sandholm’s model (2008) of preference evolution, we build an agent-based model to see how the variance of preferences in the entire society quantitatively changes over time.

Untreated cells were observed to enter the BNC scaffold in significant numbers, form clusters and retain a high viability after 48 h. To validate the assay’s usability for drug development, the treatments of SW480 cells were performed using aspirin, an agent known to reduce the migratory potential of this cell line in culture. This study demonstrates the application of BNC as a scaffold for cell migration testing as a low-cost alternative to commercial assays based on the Boyden chamber principle.

Pellet semantic reasoner was used to apply those rules onto the case study. The results include two main findings. First, our system effectively detected conflicts when subjected to four types of disturbances. Secondly, suggestions of conflict resolutions were effective when implemented albeit they were not efficient. Consequently, our two hypotheses were accepted which gave merit for future works intended to develop scheduling as a web service. Future works will include three phases: (1) migration of our system to a graph database server, (2) a multi-agent system to automate conflict resolution and data entry, and (3) an optimisation mechanism for manufacturer prioritisation to scheduling services.","Technology and Design, Canterbury Christ Church University; University of Birmingham; University of Birmingham",Cogent Engineering

This study found that the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) inducer SNAI1 was markedly reduced in <i>Salmonella</i>-treated melanoma cells, as revealed by immunoblotting. Furthermore, wound healing and transwell assays showed a reduced in vitro cell migration following <i>Salmonella</i> treatment.

Conversely to traditional zone-based approaches, the framework keeps full details of households and individuals for residential and travel mode choice, making the model highly consistent with theory. In addition, results and policy constraints are implemented at a very fine resolution (20m) and can thus incorporate local effects (residential externalities, local urban design). Conversely to fully disaggregated approaches, a linkage is organized at an intermediate scale, which allows (i) to simplify the generation and spatial distribution of trips, (ii) to parallelise parts of the residential choice simulation, and (iii) to ensure a good calibration of the population and real estate market estimates.

However, the potential toxicity of Tub-A on oocyte maturation and asymmetric division is still unclear. Therefore, the present study was designed to examine the effect and potential regulatory role of Tub-A on the meiotic maturation of oocytes. We observed that Tub-A treatment induced an increased level of the acetylation of α-tubulin, and a failure of spindle migration and actin cap formation. Based on the spindle structure, most Tub-A treated oocytes were arrested in an MI-like or a GVBD-like stage and exhibited decondensed chromosomes in a dose dependent manner. Moreover, Tub-A treatment decreased the protein expression of mTOR, a factor responsible for spindle formation, and the expression of mDia1, an inhibitor of actin assembly, in an HDAC6 expression-dependent manner. Importantly, following Tub-A supplementation, most oocytes failed to extrude the first polar body, which indicates that these defects are closely linked to abnormal oocyte maturation. Taken together, our data demonstrates that HDAC6 is one of the essential factors for oocyte maturation and asymmetric division via the HDAC6/mTOR or mDia1 pathway in mice.","Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology, Humanized Pig Research Center (SRC), Konkuk University; Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology, Humanized Pig Research Center (SRC), Konkuk University; Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology, Humanized Pig Research Center (SRC), Konkuk University",Scientific Reports

However, with the sinking of computing power, user mobility brings new challenges: since it is usually unstable, services should be dynamically migrated between multiple edge servers to maintain service performance, that is, user-perceived latency. Considering that Mobile Edge Computing is a highly distributed computing environment and it is difficult to synchronize information between servers, in order to ensure the real-time performance of the migration strategy, a virtual machine migration strategy based on Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning is proposed in this paper. The method of centralized training and distributed execution is adopted, that is, the transfer action is guided by the global information during training, and only the local observation information is needed to obtain the transfer action. Compared with the centralized control method, the proposed method alleviates communication bottleneck. Compared with other distributed control methods, this method only needs local information, does not need communication between servers, and speeds up the perception of the current environment. Migration strategies can be generated faster. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy is better than the contrast strategy in terms of convergence and energy consumption.","Software College, Northeastern University, Shenyang 110169, China; Software College, Northeastern University, Shenyang 110169, China; Computer Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang 110169, China",Applied Sciences

Our previous study identified pectolinarigenin as a novel effective anti-tumor drug candidate for NPC. In this study, we further investigated its anti-tumor activities and explored the potential molecular mechanism. Methods: NPC C666-1 cells were cultured and treated by pectolinarigenin. Cell proliferation assay, colony formation assay, Transwell assay and wound healing assay were conducted and cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. Mitochondrial transmembrane potential and ROS were also observed. NPC subcutaneous xenograft mice model was established to evaluate the anti-tumor effect of pectolinarigenin in vivo. Results: We observed that treatment of pectolinarigenin inhibited cell viability and cell migration of NPC C666-1 cells in concentration- and time-dependent manner. Pectolinarigenin induced cell apoptosis in C666-1 cells detected by flow cytometry analysis, which was associated with the activation of mitochondrial-related apoptosis and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

The present study investigates the anti-angiogenic potential of Panduratin A (PA), a natural chalcone isolated from Boesenbergia rotunda by using both in vitro and in vivo assays.<h4>Methodology/principal findings</h4>PA exerted selective cytotoxicity on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with IC(50) value of 6.91 ± 0.85 µM when compared to human normal fibroblast and normal liver epithelial cells. Assessment of the growth kinetics by cell impedance-based Real-Time Cell Analyzer showed that PA induced both cytotoxic and cytostatic effects on HUVECs, depending on the concentration used. Results also showed that PA suppressed VEGF-induced survival and proliferation of HUVECs. Furthermore, endothelial cell migration, invasion, and morphogenesis or tube formation demonstrated significant time- and dose-dependent inhibition by PA. PA also suppressed matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) secretion and attenuated its activation to intermediate and active MMP-2. In addition, PA suppressed F-actin stress fiber formation to prevent migration of the endothelial cells. More importantly, anti-angiogenic potential of PA was also evidenced in two in vivo models. PA inhibited neo-vessels formation in murine Matrigel plugs, and angiogenesis in zebrafish embryos.<h4>Conclusions/significance</h4>Taken together, our study demonstrated the distinctive anti-angiogenic properties of PA, both in vitro and in vivo. This report thus reveals another biological activity of PA in addition to its reported anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities, suggestive of PA's potential for development as an anti-angiogenic agent for cancer therapy.",NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN,PLoS ONE

It is therefore pressing to develop effective strategies to prevent and suppress tumor metastasis in its early stages. Heparanase overexpression is significantly associated with increased malignancy and metastasis. Here, we develop a novel heparanase degradable heparin-based microcarrier, HBMA, for specific staining, targeting, and inhibiting tumor cells with high metastatic potential. HBMA is fabricated through self-assembling of three components, positively charged fluorescent gold nanoclusters (KG-AuNCs), heparin polymers (HP), and antisense miRNA-21 oligonucleotides (AM-21), with each component playing multiple roles. Results of confocal microscopy and flow cytometry show that this agent has an excellent capability to label metastatic tumor cells with high selectivity. On the therapeutic side, the results of cell viability assay, wound healing assay, and plate colony formation assay verify that HBMA induces a significant inhibition effect towards the proliferation and migration of the selectively target tumor cells. The heparanase responsive AM-21 delivery, the specific staining, and the efficient tumor cell activity suppression highlight HBMA as a promising cancer theranostic agent to prevent tumor metastasis.","State Key Laboratory of Heavy Oil Processing, College of Chemical Engineering, China University of Petroleum (East China), Qingdao 266580, China; State Key Laboratory of Heavy Oil Processing, College of Chemical Engineering, China University of Petroleum (East China), Qingdao 266580, China; Corresponding authors.; State Key Laboratory of Heavy Oil Processing, College of Chemical Engineering, China University of Petroleum (East China), Qingdao 266580, China; State Key Laboratory of Heavy Oil Processing, College of Chemical Engineering, China University of Petroleum (East China), Qingdao 266580, China; State Key Laboratory of Heavy Oil Processing, College of Chemical Engineering, China University of Petroleum (East China), Qingdao 266580, China; State Key Laboratory of Heavy Oil Processing, College of Chemical Engineering, China University of Petroleum (East China), Qingdao 266580, China; State Key Laboratory of Heavy Oil Processing, College of Chemical Engineering, China University of Petroleum (East China), Qingdao 266580, China; State Key Laboratory of Heavy Oil Processing, College of Chemical Engineering, China University of Petroleum (East China), Qingdao 266580, China; State Key Laboratory of Heavy Oil Processing, College of Chemical Engineering, China University of Petroleum (East China), Qingdao 266580, China; Department of Life Sciences and Chemistry, Jacobs University Bremen, Campus Ring 1, 28759 Bremen, Germany; State Key Laboratory of Heavy Oil Processing, College of Chemical Engineering, China University of Petroleum (East China), Qingdao 266580, China; Corresponding authors.",Materials & Design

The results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and <sup>13</sup>C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) showed that PDTBP was successfully synthesized. Compared with the traditional intumescent flame retardant (IFR) system contained APP and pentaerythritol (PER), the novel IFR system (APP/PDTBP, weight ratio of 2:1) could significantly promote the flame retardancy, water resistance, and thermal stability of HDPE. The HDPE/APP/PDTBP composites (PE3) could achieve a UL-94 V-0 rating with LOI value of 30.8%, and had a lower migration percentage (2.2%). However, the HDPE/APP/PER composites (PE5) had the highest migration percentage (4.7%), lower LOI value of 23.9%, and could only achieve a UL-94 V-1 rating. Besides, the peak of heat release rate (PHRR), total heat release (THR), and fire hazard value of PE3 were markedly decreased compared to PE5. PE3 had higher tensile strength and flexural strength of 16.27 &#177; 0.42 MPa and 32.03 &#177; 0.59 MPa, respectively. Furthermore, the possible flame-retardant mechanism of the APP/PDTBP IFR system indicated that compact and continuous intumescent char layer would be formed during burning, thus inhibiting the degradation of substrate material and improving the thermal stability of HDPE.","School of Materials Science and Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, 122 Luoshi Road, Wuhan 430070, China; School of Materials Science and Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, 122 Luoshi Road, Wuhan 430070, China; State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Materials Synthesis and Processing, Wuhan University of Technology, 122 Luoshi Road, Wuhan 430070, China; School of Materials Science and Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, 122 Luoshi Road, Wuhan 430070, China; School of Materials Science and Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, 122 Luoshi Road, Wuhan 430070, China",Polymers

The parasite is distributed over a vast area in northern Eurasia and North America, but the impact of AE on human health is highly uneven between different regions. One hypothetical reason for this difference in virulence may be the genetic structure of E. multilocularis which—based on mitochondrial sequences and EmsB microsatellite profiles—forms four distinct clades. These clades correspond approximately to their continents of origin: Asia, Europe, and North America, with a fourth clade apparently restricted to Mongolia and neighboring regions, even though this clade has not yet been described by EmsB genotyping. However, there are various records of genetic variants from the “wrong” region, e.g., “European” haplotypes in Western Canada, which may be the result of introduction or natural migration of host animals. One such example, prompting this study, is the recent record of an “Asian” mitochondrial haplotype in worms from foxes in Poland. At the time, this could not be confirmed by EmsB microsatellite analysis, a method that has proven to possess greater discriminatory power with the E. multilocularis nuclear genome than sequencing of mitochondrial markers. Therefore, worms collected from foxes in Poland were examined both by EmsB analysis and sequencing of the full mitochondrial cox1 gene in order to allocate the samples to the European or Asian cluster. Based on EmsB analyses of 349 worms from 97 Polish red foxes, 92% of the worms clearly showed “European-type” EmsB profiles, but 27 worms (8%) from seven foxes showed profiles that clustered with samples of Asian origin. According to cox1 sequences, a total of 18 worms from 8 foxes belonged to the Asian cluster of haplotypes. The two methods did not fully agree: only 13 worms from three foxes belonged to Asian clusters by both EmsB and cox1, whereas 18 worms from nine foxes belonged to different clusters, according to each marker. Cross-fertilization between worms of Asian origin and those from the European Polish population may explain these conflicting results. The presence of clearly Asian elements in the Polish E. multilocularis population could be the result of introduction of E. multilocularis with host animals (e.g., domestic dogs), or the migration of foxes. In the absence of genetic data from eastern European countries, especially those bordering Poland, it cannot be concluded whether this Asian admixture is typical for a larger area toward central/eastern Europe, or the Polish parasite population is the western extreme of a gradient where both European and Asian elements mingle. Further studies are needed on this subject, preferably using both mitochondrial sequencing and EmsB microsatellite analysis.","Wildlife Surveillance and Eco-Epidemiology Unit, National Reference Laboratory for Echinococcus spp., Rabies and Wildlife Laboratory, ANSES, Malzéville, France; UMR CNRS 6249 Laboratoire Chrono-Environnement, Université Franche-Comté, Besançon, France; Department of Parasitology-Mycology, National Reference Centre for Echinococcoses, University Hospital of Besançon, Besançon, France; Parasitology Unit, University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart, Germany; Wildlife Surveillance and Eco-Epidemiology Unit, National Reference Laboratory for Echinococcus spp., Rabies and Wildlife Laboratory, ANSES, Malzéville, France; Wildlife Surveillance and Eco-Epidemiology Unit, National Reference Laboratory for Echinococcus spp., Rabies and Wildlife Laboratory, ANSES, Malzéville, France; Wildlife Surveillance and Eco-Epidemiology Unit, National Reference Laboratory for Echinococcus spp., Rabies and Wildlife Laboratory, ANSES, Malzéville, France; Department of Parasitology, National Veterinary Research Institute, Pulawy, Poland; Parasitology Unit, University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart, Germany; Department of Parasitology, National Veterinary Research Institute, Pulawy, Poland",Frontiers in Veterinary Science

Our results demonstrated that treatment with exogenous BMP-7 markedly increased cell migration by activating c-Src/PI3K/Akt/IKK/NF-κB signaling pathway, resulting in the transactivation of αvβ3 integrin expression. Indeed, abrogation of signaling activation, by chemical inhibition or expression of a kinase dead form of the protein attenuated BMP-7-induced expression of integrin αvβ3 and cell migration.

The antidiabetic agent metformin has shown its ability to inhibit tumor angiogenesis in metastatic breast cancer models. However, it remains unclear if or how metformin remodels the abnormal vasculature of metastatic breast cancer, while inhibiting angiogenesis. Methods Metastatic breast cancer models were constructed to compare microvessel density (MVD), vascular maturity and function, lung metastasis and chemosensitivity in metformin-treated or untreated mice. Protein array assay and transcriptome sequencing were performed for genetic screening. Lentiviral shRNA-PDGF-B transfection was used for observing the contribution of PDGF-B knockdown to metformin’s vascular effects. Results Metastatic breast cancers were characterized by an excessively angiogenic, immature and morphologically abnormal vasculature. Compared to control, metformin significantly reduced MVD, leakage and hypoxia, and increased vascular mural cells coverage and perfusion, namely, “vessel normalization”. Metformin at human blood concentrations had no direct effect on the migration and proliferation of cancer cells. Based on that, reduced lung metastasis of the primary tumor and improved chemosensitization by metformin were assumed to be mediated via metformin’s vascular effects. Further results of genetic screening and in vivo experiments showed that the downregulation of platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF-B) greatly contributed to the metformin-induced vessel normalization. Conclusions These findings provide pre-clinical evidences for the vascular mechanism of metformin-induced metastasis inhibition and the chemosensitization of metastatic breast cancers.","Department of Vascular Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital of Xi’an Jiaotong University; Department of Science and Technology, First Affiliated Hospital of Xi’an Jiaotong University; Center for Translational Medicine, First Affiliated Hospital of Xi’an Jiaotong University; Department of Oncological Radiotherapy, First Affiliated Hospital of Xi’an Jiaotong University; Department of Thoracic Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital of Xi’an Jiaotong University; Department of Pathology, First Affiliated Hospital of Xi’an Jiaotong University; Department of Breast Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital of Xi’an Jiaotong University; Department of Medical Oncology, First Affiliated Hospital of Xi’an Jiaotong University; Department of Vascular Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital of Xi’an Jiaotong University; Department of Vascular Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital of Xi’an Jiaotong University; Department of Vascular Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital of Xi’an Jiaotong University; Department of Neurosurgery, First Affiliated Hospital of Xi’an Jiaotong University; Center for Translational Medicine, First Affiliated Hospital of Xi’an Jiaotong University",Journal of Experimental & Clinical Cancer Research

Tip cells meet and fuse (anastomosis) to form blood-flow supporting loops. Tip cell selection is achieved by Dll4-Notch mediated lateral inhibition resulting, under normal conditions, in an interleaved arrangement of tip and non-migrating stalk cells. Previously, we showed that the increased VEGF levels found in many diseases can cause the delayed negative feedback of lateral inhibition to produce abnormal oscillations of tip/stalk cell fates. Here we describe the development and implementation of a novel physics-based hierarchical agent model, tightly coupled to in vivo data, to explore the system dynamics as perpetual lateral inhibition combines with tip cell migration and fusion. We explore the tipping point between normal and abnormal sprouting as VEGF increases. A novel filopodia-adhesion driven migration mechanism is presented and validated against in vivo data. Due to the unique feature of ongoing lateral inhibition, 'stabilised' tip/stalk cell patterns show sensitivity to the formation of new cell-cell junctions during fusion: we predict cell fates can reverse. The fusing tip cells become inhibited and neighbouring stalk cells flip fate, recursively providing new tip cells. Junction size emerges as a key factor in establishing a stable tip/stalk pattern. Cell-cell junctions elongate as tip cells migrate, which is shown to provide positive feedback to lateral inhibition, causing it to be more susceptible to pathological oscillations. Importantly, down-regulation of the migratory pathway alone is shown to be sufficient to rescue the sprouting system from oscillation and restore stability. Thus we suggest the use of migration inhibitors as therapeutic agents for vascular normalisation in cancer.",NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN,PLoS Computational Biology

Investigators have applied various computational approaches to understand the impact the internal dynamics of such devices has on overall cell growth, but such models cannot provide a comprehensive perspective regarding the system dynamics, due to limitations inherent to the underlying approaches. In this study, a novel multi-paradigm modeling platform capable of simulating the dynamic bidirectional relationship between cells and their microenvironment is presented. Designing the modeling platform entailed combining and coupling fully an agent-based modeling platform with a transport phenomena computational modeling framework. To demonstrate capability, the platform was used to study the impact of bioreactor parameters on the overall cell population behavior and vice versa. In order to achieve this, virtual bioreactors were constructed and seeded. The virtual cells, guided by a set of rules involving the simulated mass transport inside the bioreactor, as well as cell-related probabilistic parameters, were capable of displaying an array of behaviors such as proliferation, migration, chemotaxis and apoptosis. In this way the platform was shown to capture not only the impact of bioreactor transport processes on cellular behavior but also the influence that cellular activity wields on that very same local mass transport, thereby influencing overall cell growth. The platform was validated by simulating cellular chemotaxis in a virtual direct visualization chamber and comparing the simulation with its experimental analogue. The results presented in this paper are in agreement with published models of similar flavor. The modeling platform can be used as a concept selection tool to optimize bioreactor design specifications.",NaN; NaN; NaN,PLoS ONE

Design thinking has been successfully deployed as an agent for social change. In this paper we take a trans-disciplinary approach to social design in remote villages of Uttarakhand, India. Lack of employment opportunities and tough sustenance in the mountainous regions of India has led to mass migration and ghost villages. Recent interventions at the micro level, born from a participatory approach rather than the top down structure of government development schemes, have been seen to be more effective in tackling this complex socio-economic issue. Community based participatory research has been deployed previously in areas like public health and primary education successfully. With this paper we reflect on the viability of using it to identify areas of effective design intervention, not just to address current issues faced by the residents of remote villages in the Himalayas but also to encourage future social entrepreneurs. We worked in a group of Himalayan villages in collaboration with local government agents as part of a month long design education module. Design students and development professionals teamed up with residents, using methods like transect walks, socio-cultural mapping of health, water and sanitation, education, leadership, mobility, skill and vulnerability and co-design activities. Analysis led to a deeper understanding of social structure, education, resource equity, power dynamics, flow of information, drudgery, vulnerability and potential areas for social entrepreneurs. An iterative model of exploration, analysis, design proposition and refinement was followed to identify challenges faced by residents and areas of possible design intervention.","School of Design, Doon University, Dehradun, India; School of Design, Doon University, Dehradun, India",Discern

However, if radar devices of diverse capabilities can be combined to realize collaborative networked operation, the reliability and performance of a radar system in a complex environment can be significantly improved. This paper classify the networked radar-based multi-objective task planning as a combinatorial optimization problem with constraints and abstract a distributed multi-agent system (MAS) model from a networked radar system. A node-selection algorithm was designed based on a greedy policy to narrow down solution space for subsequent networked radar task planning, reduce the amount of calculation, and improve the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, focusing on NSGA-II, the proposed algorithm was modified using self-adaptive operators and reinforcement learning. A dual-population strategy was introduced to allow exchanges of multiple individuals between populations during migration, and the number of individuals for the exchange was obtained through reinforcement learning. In this paper, five algorithms are compared and analyzed. In addition, statistical analyses are conducted from four perspectives: the average evaluation value of energy consumption and bandwidth in the Pareto front solutions, the time consumption of the algorithm, and the diversity of the population. The results indicate that among those algorithms, the reinforcement-learning-based RNSGA-II algorithm can produce the best outcomes for networked radar task planning.","Department of Computer Science, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA; School of Computer Science, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China; School of Computer Science, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China; School of Computer Science, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China",IEEE Access

Eel passes, narrow sloping channels lined with substrata that enable elvers to ascend, are one way to mitigate against these barriers. Currently, studded eel tiles are a popular substrate. This study is the first to evaluate the flow fields within studded eel tiles and to model the swimming performance of elvers using cellular automata (CA) and individual- (or agent-) based models. Velocities and flow depths predicted by a computational fluid dynamics model of studded eel tiles are first validated against published values for a single installation angle–discharge combination. The validated model is then used to compute three-dimensional flow fields for eel passes at five different installation angles and three inflow discharges. CA and individual-based models are employed to assess upstream passage efficiency for a range of elver sizes. The individual-based model approximates measured passage efficiencies better than the CA model. Passage efficiency is greatest for shallow slopes, low discharges and large elvers.

A relatively new effort of predictive oncology is to develop a paradigm for forecasting the future status of an individual tumor given initial conditions and an appropriate mathematical model. The objective of this study was to introduce a comprehensive multiscale computational method to predict cancer and microvascular network growth patterns. A rectangular lattice-based model was designed so different evolutionary scenarios could be simulated and for predicting the impact of diffusible factors on tumor morphology and size. Further, the model allows prediction-based simulation of cell and microvascular behavior. Like a single cell, each agent is fully realized within the model and interactions are governed in part by machine learning methods. This multiscale computational model was developed and incorporated input information from in vivo microscale computed tomography (microCT) images acquired from breast cancer-bearing mice. It was found that as the difference between expansion of the cancer cell population and microvascular network increases, cells undergo proliferation and migration with a greater probability compared to other phenotypes. Overall, multiscale computational model agreed with both theoretical expectations and experimental findings (microCT images) not used during model training.","Department of Bioengineering, University of Texas at Dallas; Department of Bioengineering, University of Texas at Dallas; Department of Bioengineering, University of Texas at Dallas",Scientific Reports

The advent of biologic therapies has revolutionized the management of Crohn&amp;rsquo;s disease. Specifically, antibodies to tumor necrosis factor alpha induce rapid mucosal healing. This translates into improved patient outcomes. However, many patients will fail these and other therapies. Natalizumab is a new biologic agent that has been approved for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn&amp;rsquo;s disease in patients who have failed or are intolerant to immunosuppressants and/or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors. It is a selective adhesion molecule inhibitor to alpha-4 integrin resulting in inhibition of the migration of inflammatory cells across the endothelium. This unique mechanism of action has been shown to be effective in the treatment of Crohn&amp;rsquo;s disease, making it an important option for otherwise refractory patients. Its use has been limited to these refractory patients because of concerns about the development of complications, especially progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.

Objective: To demonstrate the presence of RVC in Indian swine population and characterization of its selected structural (VP6) and non-structural (NSP4 and NSP5) genes. Methods: A total of 108 diarrheic samples from different regions of India were used. Isolated RNA was loaded onto polyacrylamide gel to screen for the presence of RVs through the identification of specific electrophoretic genomic migration pattern. To characterize the RVC strains, VP6 gene and NSP4 and NSP5 genes were amplified, sequenced and analyzed. Results: Based on VP6 gene specific diagnostic RT-PCR, the presence of RVC was confirmed in 12.0% (13/108) piglet fecal specimens. The nucleotide sequence analysis of VP6 gene, encoding inner capsid protein, from selected porcine RVC (PoRVC) strains revealed more than 93% homologies to human RVC strains (HuRVC) of Eurasian origin. These strains were distant from hitherto reported PoRVCs and clustered with HuRVCs, owning I2 genotype. However, the two non-structural genes, i.e. NSP4 and NSP5, of these strains were found to be of swine type, signifying a re-assortment event that has occurred in the Indian swine population. Conclusion: The findings indicate the presence of human-like RVC in Indian pigs and division of RVC clade with I2 genotype into further sub-clades.

Invasive cluster formation has been assumed to be dependent on directed migration and a heterogeneous environment - a conclusion derived from complex models of tumor-environment interaction. At the same time, these models have not included the prospect, now supported by a preponderance of evidence, that only a minority of cancer cells may have stem cell capacity. This proves to weigh heavily on the microenvironmental requirements for the display of characteristic tumor growth phenotypes. We show using agent-based modeling that some defining features of tumor growth ascribed to directed migration might also be realized under random migration, and discuss broader implications for cause-and-effect determination in general.</p> <p>Results</p> <p>Considering only the properties of random migration in tumors composed of stem cells and committed cells, we are able to recapitulate a characteristic clustering feature of invasive tumor growth, a property we attribute to ""self-metastatic"" growth.

While higher-order mechanisms, e.g. directed migration upon chemotactic stimuli, may result in clustering growth morphologies, exclusive attributions of this phenotype to this or other structured microenvironments would be inappropriate, in light of our finding these features are observable in a homogeneous environment. Furthermore, directed migration will result in loss of the invasive phenotype as the tumor approaches the attractor source.

While contemporary cell replacement therapies have delivered retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) within customized biomaterials to promote viability and enable transplantation, outcomes have been severely limited by the misdirected and/or insufficient migration of transplanted cells. RPCs must achieve appropriate spatial and functional positioning in host retina, collectively, to restore vision, whereas movement of clustered cells differs substantially from the single cell migration studied in classical chemotaxis models. Defining how RPCs interact with each other, neighboring cell types and surrounding extracellular matrixes are critical to our understanding of retinogenesis and the development of effective, cell-based approaches to retinal replacement. The current article describes a new bio-engineering approach to investigate the migratory responses of innate collections of RPCs upon extracellular substrates by combining microfluidics with the well-established invertebrate model of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Experiments utilized microfluidics to investigate how the composition, size, and adhesion of RPC clusters on defined extracellular substrates affected migration to exogenous chemotactic signaling. Results demonstrated that retinal cluster size and composition influenced RPC clustering upon extracellular substrates of concanavalin (Con-A), Laminin (LM), and poly-L-lysine (PLL), and that RPC cluster size greatly altered collective migratory responses to signaling from Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF), a primary chemotactic agent in <i>Drosophila</i>. These results highlight the significance of examining collective cell-biomaterial interactions on bio-substrates of emerging biomaterials to aid directional migration of transplanted cells.

Our previous studies revealed that Rictor deletion, to disrupt mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2), over longer periods result in a paradoxical rise in platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) expression in PASMCs. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of combination therapy targeting both mTOR signaling with PDGFR inhibition to attenuate the development and progression of PAH.Methods and Results: Immunoblotting analyses revealed that short-term exposure to rapamycin (6h) significantly reduced phosphorylation of p70S6K (mTORC1-specific) in hPASMCs but had no effect on the phosphorylation of AKT (p-AKT S473, considered mTORC2-specific). In contrast, longer rapamycin exposure (&gt;24 h), resulted in differential AKT (T308) and AKT (S473) phosphorylation with increases in phosphorylation of AKT at T308 and decreased phosphorylation at S473. Phosphorylation of both PDGFRα and PDGFRβ was increased in hPASMCs after treatment with rapamycin for 48 and 72 h. Based on co-immunoprecipitation studies, longer exposure to rapamycin (24–72 h) significantly inhibited the binding of mTOR to Rictor, mechanistically suggesting mTORC2 inhibition by rapamycin. Combined exposure of rapamycin with the PDGFR inhibitor, imatinib significantly reduced the proliferation and migration of hPASMCs compared to either agent alone. Pre-clinical studies validated increased therapeutic efficacy of rapamycin combined with imatinib in attenuating PAH over either drug alone. Specifically, combination therapy further attenuated the development of monocrotaline (MCT)- or Hypoxia/Sugen-induced pulmonary hypertension (PH) in rats as demonstrated by further reductions in the Fulton index, right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), pulmonary vascular wall thickness and vessel muscularization, and decreased proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) staining in PASMCs.Conclusion: Prolonged rapamycin treatment activates PDGFR signaling, in part, via mTORC2 inhibition.

Here, we show that a novel phytoestrogen, 6-methoxyequol (6-ME), inhibited VEGF-induced proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVE) cells, whereas VEGF-induced migration and survival of HUVE cells remained unaffected. In addition, 6-ME inhibited FGF-2-induced proliferation of bovine brain capillary endothelial (BBCE) cells. In line with its role in cell proliferation, 6-ME inhibited VEGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 MAPK, the key cascade responsible for VEGF-induced proliferation of endothelial cells. In this context, 6-ME inhibited in a dose dependent manner the phosphorylation of MEK1/2, the only known upstream activator of ERK1/2. 6-ME did not alter VEGF-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK or AKT, compatible with the lack of effect on VEGF-induced migration and survival of endothelial cells. Peri-tumor injection of 6-ME in A-431 xenograft tumors resulted in reduced tumor growth with suppressed neovasularization compared to vehicle controls (P < 0.01).</p> <p>Conclusions</p> <p>6-ME inhibits VEGF- and FGF2-induced proliferation of ECs by targeting the phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and it downstream substrate ERK1/2, both key components of the mitogenic MAPK pathway.

87,"Laxmisha Rai, Jiman Hong",Conceptual Framework for Knowledge-Based Decision Migration in Multi-Component Robots,2013,"Abstract This paper presents a conceptual framework for dynamically migrating the decisions of multi-component robots within different physical subcomponents. At the higher layer, a decision-making distributed migration system embeds the rules written in a knowledge-based system (KBS). The rules are written and decisions are made at one component, which can be migrated by the underlying distributed system. This eventually results in intelligent migration of the decisions and robot survival, irrespective of a particular physical component failure. Moreover, a robot does not need an exclusive control system for each component. The implementation is a two-step process. Initially, component-specific facts are identified and mapped to suit to respective components and to write rules and explore different gestures and behaviour of the robot. The second step is the embedding of these rules within the distributed or agent-based system and allowing the decisions to float around the system. The Jess (Java Expert System Shell) expert system is used as the knowledge-based tool and different gestures are generated to realize the proposed method."," College of Information and Electrical Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China;  Intelligent Robot Research Center, Soongsil University, Seoul, Korea",International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems

Secondly, three secure needs that the virtual machine migration scheme which based on trusted computing technology should meet were proposed: the authenticated platform, confidentiality and integrity preserving transfer and atomicity of the vTPCM. Thirdly, a trusted migration scheme of virtual machines for cloud environment was proposed, in which the virtual machine central migration engine and trusted migration agent were introduced to solve the atomicity protection of vTPCM during the migration process.

How cell cycle progression affects migration, and vice versa, remains largely unknown. We address these questions by combining in silico modelling and in vivo experimentation in the zebrafish trunk neural crest (TNC). TNC migrate collectively, forming chains with a leader cell directing the movement of trailing followers. We show that the acquisition of migratory identity is autonomously controlled by Notch signalling in TNC. High Notch activity defines leaders, while low Notch determines followers. Moreover, cell cycle progression is required for TNC migration and is regulated by Notch. Cells with low Notch activity stay longer in G1 and become followers, while leaders with high Notch activity quickly undergo G1/S transition and remain in S-phase longer. In conclusion, TNC migratory identities are defined through the interaction of Notch signalling and cell cycle progression.","Randall Centre for Cell and Molecular Biophysics, Guy's Campus, King's College London, London, United Kingdom; Cellular Adaptive Behaviour Lab, Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom; Cellular Adaptive Behaviour Lab, Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom; Randall Centre for Cell and Molecular Biophysics, Guy's Campus, King's College London, London, United Kingdom; Department of Biology & Biochemistry, University of Bath, Bath, United Kingdom; Randall Centre for Cell and Molecular Biophysics, Guy's Campus, King's College London, London, United Kingdom; Committee on Development, Regeneration and Stem Cell Biology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, United States; Randall Centre for Cell and Molecular Biophysics, Guy's Campus, King's College London, London, United Kingdom; Randall Centre for Cell and Molecular Biophysics, Guy's Campus, King's College London, London, United Kingdom; Department of Biology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy; Department of Biology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy; Department of Biology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy; Department of Biology & Biochemistry, University of Bath, Bath, United Kingdom; Committee on Development, Regeneration and Stem Cell Biology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, United States; Department of Organismal Biology and Anatomy, The University of Chicago, Chicago, United States; Cellular Adaptive Behaviour Lab, Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom; Department of Informatics, King's College London, London, United Kingdom; Randall Centre for Cell and Molecular Biophysics, Guy's Campus, King's College London, London, United Kingdom",eLife
90,"Svetlana Miroshnichenko, Olga Patutina",Enhanced Inhibition of Tumorigenesis Using Combinations of miRNA-Targeted Therapeutics,2019,"The search for effective strategies to inhibit tumorigenesis remains one of the most relevant scientific challenges. Among the most promising approaches is the direct modulation of the function of short non-coding RNAs, particularly miRNAs. These molecules are propitious targets for anticancer therapy, since they perform key regulatory roles in a variety of signaling cascades related to cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion. The development of pathological states is often associated with deregulation of miRNA expression. The present review describes in detail the strategies aimed at modulating miRNA activity that invoke antisense oligonucleotide construction, such as small RNA zippers, miRNases (miRNA-targeted artificial ribonucleases), miRNA sponges, miRNA masks, anti-miRNA oligonucleotides, and synthetic miRNA mimics. The broad impact of developed miRNA-based therapeutics on the various events of tumorigenesis is also discussed. Above all, the focus of this review is to evaluate the results of the combined application of different miRNA-based agents and chemotherapeutic drugs for the inhibition of tumor development. Many studies indicate a considerable increase in the efficacy of anticancer therapy as a result of additive or synergistic effects of simultaneously applied therapies. Different drug combinations, such as a cocktail of antisense oligonucleotides or multipotent miRNA sponges directed at several oncogenic microRNAs belonging to the same/different miRNA families, a mixture of anti-miRNA oligonucleotides and cytostatic drugs, and a combination of synthetic miRNA mimics, have a more complex and profound effect on the various events of tumorigenesis as compared with treatment with a single miRNA-based agent or chemotherapeutic drug. These data provide strong evidence that the simultaneous application of several distinct strategies aimed at suppressing different cellular processes linked to tumorigenesis is a promising approach for cancer therapy.",NaN; NaN,Frontiers in Pharmacology

However, the survival, migration and therapeutic efficacy of EPCs after transplantation need to be better understood for further cell therapy. Purpose: This study investigated the migration effect of EPCs labeled with a multimodal imaging agent in a murine ischemic hindlimb model, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and optical imaging after transplantation. Methods: EPCs derived from mouse bone marrow were labeled with a multimodal imaging agent and were administered through intracardiac delivery to mice with ischemic hindlimbs. The injected EPCs and their migration effect were observed via MRI and optical imaging in vivo, and then compared to a reference standard based on histological data. The quantification of gadolinium in tissue samples was done using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Results: Using in vivo MRI and optical imaging, the labeled EPCs were observed to migrate to ischemic muscle on days 3&ndash;5 after injection, while ex vivo, the EPCs were observed in the capillary vessels of the injured tissue. There were significant linear correlations between the Gd contents measured using ICP-MS in samples from the ischemic hindlimbs and livers and T1 relaxation times calculated using MRI, as well as the average fluorescence signal intensities recorded in optical images (T1 relaxation time: r=0.491; average signal from optical imaging: r=0.704, P&lt;0.01). EPC treatment upregulated the levels of C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2 and enhanced the expression of stromal cell-derived factor-1 and VEGF.

Li, Xuan Cao",(Arg)9-SH2 superbinder: a novel promising anticancer therapy to melanoma by blocking phosphotyrosine signaling,2018,"Abstract Background Melanoma is a malignant tumor with high misdiagnosis rate and poor prognosis. The bio-targeted therapy is a prevailing method in the treatment of melanoma; however, the accompanying drug resistance is inevitable. SH2 superbinder, a triple-mutant of the Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain, shows potent antitumor ability by replacing natural SH2-containing proteins and blocking multiple pY-based signaling pathways. Polyarginine (Arg)9, a powerful vector for intracellular delivery of large molecules, could transport therapeutic agents across cell membrane. The purpose of this study is to construct (Arg)9-SH2 superbinder and investigate its effects on melanoma cells, expecting to provide potential new approaches for anti-cancer therapy and overcoming the unavoidable drug resistance of single-targeted antitumor agents. Methods (Arg)9 and SH2 superbinder were fused to form (Arg)9-SH2 superbinder via genetic engineering. Pull down assay was performed to identify that (Arg)9-SH2 superbinder could capture a wide variety of pY proteins. Immunofluorescence was used to detect the efficiency of (Arg)9-SH2 superbinder entering cells. The proliferation ability was assessed by MTT and colony formation assay. In addition, wound healing and transwell assay were performed to evaluate migration of B16F10, A375 and A375/DDP cells. Moreover, apoptosis caused by (Arg)9-SH2 superbinder was analyzed by flow cytometry-based Annexin V/PI. Furthermore, western blot revealed that (Arg)9-SH2 superbinder influenced some pY-related signaling pathways. Finally, B16F10 xenograft model was established to confirm whether (Arg)9-SH2 superbinder could restrain the growth of tumor. Results Our data showed that (Arg)9-SH2 superbinder had the ability to enter melanoma cells effectively and displayed strong affinities for various pY proteins. Furthermore, (Arg)9-SH2 superbinder could repress proliferation, migration and induce apoptosis of melanoma cells by regulating PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK and JAK/STAT signaling pathways. Importantly, (Arg)9-SH2 superbinder could significantly inhibit the growth of tumor in mice. Conclusions (Arg)9-SH2 superbinder exhibited high affinities for pY proteins, which showed effective anticancer ability by replacing SH2-containing proteins and blocking diverse pY-based pathways. The remarkable ability of (Arg)9-SH2 superbinder to inhibit cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth might open the door to explore the SH2 superbinder as a therapeutic agent for cancer treatment.","Department of Medical Genetics, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology; Department of Medical Genetics, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology; Department of Medical Genetics, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology; Department of Medical Genetics, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology; Department of Medical Genetics, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology; Department of Biochemistry, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University; Department of Biochemistry, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University; Department of Medical Genetics, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology",Journal of Experimental & Clinical Cancer Research

We recently generated a novel lead quinazoline-based Doxazosin® derivative, DZ-50, which impairs tumor growth and metastasis via anoikis. Genome-wide analysis in the human prostate cancer cell line DU-145 identified primary downregulated targets of DZ-50, including genes involved in focal adhesion integrity (fibronectin, integrin-α6 and talin), tight junction formation (claudin-11) as well as insulin growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) and the angiogenesis modulator thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1). Confocal microscopy demonstrated structural disruption of both focal adhesions and tight junctions by the downregulation of these gene targets, resulting in decreased cell survival, migration and adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) components in two androgen-independent human prostate cancer cell lines, PC-3 and DU-145. Stabilization of cell-ECM interactions by overexpression of talin-1 and/or exposing cells to a fibronectin-rich environment mitigated the effect of DZ-50. Loss of expression of the intracellular focal adhesion signaling effectors talin-1 and integrin linked kinase (ILK) sensitized human prostate cancer to anoikis.

Platelets consist of 3 types of granules: alpha granules, dense granules and lysosomes. Granule secretion releases coagulation factors, growth factors, cytokines, and a number of proteolytic enzymes. Platelets contain a number of receptors known as platelet agonists. Basic and most studied role of platelets is in hemostasis process. The aim of this paper is to point on platelet function unrelated to hemostasis. Matherials and methods: Papers on other recognized functions of platelets were searched for in biomedical journals idexed in MEDLINE form 2004 to 2016. Topic: This paper studies less known platelet functions becoming subject of interest with the development of applied science. Platelets participate in inflammation by releasing proinflammatory mediators (CD154, CD40L). Complement activation via Pselectin, platelet-generates immunomodulatory effect. CD40L accelerates releasing RANTES protein leading to intensified activation of T-lymphocytes. During embryonic development, platelets allow blood and lymph vessels separation by activating CLE-2 receptor and ligand PDPN. Platelets alleviate migration and invasiveness of tumor cells, contribute to disease progression and development of metastases. Platelets affect maturation of follicles and oocytes and have important role in embryo implantation process and placentation. Conclusion: Based on these findings, conclusion imposes platelets as not only active participants in the hemostasis process but as having significant role in inflammation, unspecified and specified body defending, tumor biology, embryonic development and in female reproductive system regulation. Numerous roles of platelets open wide range for the new drugs' operation. Their specific characteristic is the basis for the personalized Clinical pharmacology development and possibility of applying specific drug as polyindicative therapeutic agent.","Klinički centar Srbije, Beograd; Klinički centar Srbije, Beograd; Specjalna bolnica za psihijatrijska oboljenja 'Kovin', Kovin; Klinički centar Srbije, Beograd",Hospital Pharmacology

Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is a medical complication of allogeneic tissue transplantation with transplanted donor T cell-mediated inflammatory response; it is characterized by a severe immune response with fibrosis in the final stage of the inflammatory process. T helper 17 cells play a critical role in the pathogenesis of GvHD. Fingolimod (FTY720), an analogue of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), is an effective immunosuppressive agent in experimental transplantation models. Methods In this study, we evaluated the effects of FTY720 as a treatment for an animal GvHD model with inflammation and fibrosis. The splenocytes, lymph nodes, blood, tissues from Syngeneic mice and GvHD-induced mice treated vehicle or FTY720 were compared using flow cytometry, hematological analyses, histologic analyses. Results FTY720 reduced clinical scores based on the following five clinical parameters: weight loss, posture, activity, fur texture, and skin integrity. FACS data showed that T lymphocyte numbers increased in mesenteric lymph nodes and decreased in splenocytes of FTY720-treated mice. Tissue analysis showed that FTY720 reduced skin, intestinal inflammation, and fibrotic markers. FTY720 dramatically decreased α-smooth muscle actin, connective tissue growth factor, and fibronectin protein levels in keloid skin fibroblasts. Conclusions Thus, FTY720 suppressed migration of pathogenic T cells to target organs, reducing inflammation. FTY720 also inhibited fibrogenesis marker expression in vitro and in vivo. Together, these results suggest that FTY720 prevents GvHD progression via immunosuppression of TH17 and simultaneously acts an anti-fibrotic agent.","The Rheumatism Research Center, Catholic Research Institute of Medical Science, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea; The Rheumatism Research Center, Catholic Research Institute of Medical Science, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea; The Rheumatism Research Center, Catholic Research Institute of Medical Science, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea; The Rheumatism Research Center, Catholic Research Institute of Medical Science, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea; The Rheumatism Research Center, Catholic Research Institute of Medical Science, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea; The Rheumatism Research Center, Catholic Research Institute of Medical Science, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea; The Rheumatism Research Center, Catholic Research Institute of Medical Science, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea; Division of Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea; The Rheumatism Research Center, Catholic Research Institute of Medical Science, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea",Journal of Translational Medicine

Containers provide an ideal way for practical implementation of microservice-based architecture, which allows for repeatable, generic patterns that make the development of reliable, distributed applications more approachable and efficient. Orchestrators allow for shifting the accidental complexity from inside of an application into the automated cloud infrastructure. Existing container orchestrators are centralized systems that schedule containers to the cloud servers only at their startup. In this paper, we propose a swarm-like distributed cloud management system that uses live migration of containers to dynamically reassign application components to the different servers. It is based on the idea of “pheromone” robots. An additional mobile agent process is placed inside each application container to control the migration process. The number of parallel container migrations needed to reach an optimal state of the cloud is obtained using models, experiments, and simulations. We show that in the most common scenarios the proposed swarm-like algorithm performs better than existing systems, and due to its architecture it is also more scalable and resilient to container death. It also adapts to the influx of containers and addition of new servers to the cloud automatically.","Institute of Information Technology, Warsaw University of Life Sciences—SGGW, ul.

Methods: We retrospectively collected data on patients with advanced HCC who received lenvatinib as the first-line agent in 7 institutions. Results: Overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS) of 178 patients who received lenvatinib as the first-line agent were 13.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.5–15.2) and 6.7 months (95% CI, 5.6–7.8), respectively. Sixty-nine of 151 patients (45.7%) who discontinued lenvatinib moved on to posttreatment. The migration rates from lenvatinib to the second-line agent and from the second-line agent to the third-line agent were 41.7 and 44.4%, respectively. Based on multivariate analysis, response to lenvatinib (complete or partial response according to modified RECIST) and discontinuation of lenvatinib due to radiological progression, as well as male were associated with a significantly higher probability of migration to posttreatment after lenvatinib. On the other hand, alpha-fetoprotein levels of 400 ng/mL or higher was correlated with a significantly lower probability of migration to posttreatment after lenvatinib.

While most OvCa patients initially respond to surgical debulking and chemotherapy, 75% of patients later succumb to the disease. Thus, there is an urgent need to test novel therapeutic agents to counteract the high mortality rate associated with OvCa. In this context, we have developed and engineered Nanoceria (NCe), nanoparticles of cerium oxide, possessing anti-oxidant properties, to be used as a therapeutic agent in OvCa. We show for the first time that NCe significantly inhibited production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in A2780 cells, attenuated growth factor (SDF1, HB-EGF, VEGF(165) and HGF) mediated cell migration and invasion of SKOV3 cells, without affecting the cell proliferation. NCe treatment also inhibited VEGF(165) induced proliferation, capillary tube formation, activation of VEGFR2 and MMP2 in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC). NCe (0.1 mg/kg body weigh) treatment of A2780 ovarian cancer cells injected intra-peritoneally in nude mice showed significant reduction (p<0.002) in tumor growth accompanied by decreased tumor cell proliferation as evident from reduced tumor size and Ki67 staining. Accumulation of NCe was found in tumors isolated from treated group using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS).

100,"Erica L Nelson, Saira A Khan, Swapna Thorve, P Gregg Greenough",Modeling pastoralist movement in response to environmental variables and conflict in Somaliland: Combining agent-based modeling and geospatial data.,2020,"Pastoralism is widely practiced in arid lands and is the primary means of livelihood for approximately 268 million people across Africa. Environmental, interpersonal, and transactional variables such as vegetation and water availability, conflict, ethnic tensions, and private/public land delineation influence the movements of these populations. The challenges of climate change and conflict are widely felt by nomadic pastoralists in Somalia, where resources are scarce, natural disasters are increasingly common, and protracted conflict has plagued communities for decades. Bereft of real-time data, researchers and programmatic personnel often turn to post hoc analysis to understand the interaction between climate, conflict, and migration, and design programs to address the needs of nomadic pastoralists. By designing an Agent-Based Model to simulate the movement of nomadic pastoralists based on typologically-diverse, historical data of environmental, interpersonal, and transactional variables in Somaliland and Puntland between 2008 and 2018, this study explores how pastoralists respond to changing environments. Through subsequent application of spatial analysis such as choropleth maps, kernel density mapping, and standard deviational ellipses, we characterize the resultant pastoralist population distribution in response to these variables. Outcomes demonstrate a large scale spatio-temporal trend of pastoralists migrating to the southeast of the study area with high density areas in the south of Nugaal, the northwest of Sool, and along the Ethiopian border. While minimal inter-seasonal variability is seen, multiple analyses support the consolidation of pastoralists to specifically favorable regions. Exploration of the large-scale population, climate, and conflict trends allows for cogent narratives and associative hypotheses regarding the pastoralist migration during the study period. While this model produces compelling associations between pastoralist movements and terrestrial and conflict variables, it relies heavily on assumptions and incomplete data that are not necessarily representative of realities on the ground. Given the paucity of data regarding pastoralist decision-making and migration, validation remains challenging.",NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN,PLoS ONE

Due to the positive costs-benefits ratio of including soybean meal in farmed fish diets, identifying additives with intestinal anti-inflammatory effects could contribute to solving the issues caused by this plant protein. This study evaluated the effect of incorporating lactoferrin (LF) into a soybean meal-based diet on intestinal inflammation in zebrafish. Larvae were fed with diets containing 50% soybean meal (50SBM) or 50SBM supplemented with LF to 0.5, 1, 1.5 g/kg (50SBM+LF0.5; 50SBM+LF1.0; 50SBM+LF1.5). The 50SBM+LF1.5 diet was the most efficient and larvae had a reduced number of neutrophils in the intestine compared with 50SBM larvae and an indistinguishable number compared with control larvae. Likewise, the transcription of genes involved in neutrophil migration and intestinal mucosal barrier functions (mmp9, muc2.2, and β-def-1) were increased in 50SBM larvae but were normally expressed in 50SBM+LF1.5 larvae. To determine the influence of intestinal inflammation on the general immune response, larvae were challenged with Edwardsiella tarda. Larvae with intestinal inflammation had increased mortality rate compared to control larvae. Importantly, 50SBM+LF1.5 larvae had a mortality rate lower than control larvae. These results demonstrate that LF displays a dual effect in zebrafish, acting as an intestinal anti-inflammatory agent and improving performance against bacterial infection.","Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Andrés Bello, Republica 217, 8370146 Santiago, Chile; Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Andrés Bello, Republica 217, 8370146 Santiago, Chile; Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Andrés Bello, Republica 217, 8370146 Santiago, Chile; Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Andrés Bello, Republica 217, 8370146 Santiago, Chile; Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Andrés Bello, Republica 217, 8370146 Santiago, Chile; Núcleo de Investigación en Producción Alimentaria, Escuela de Acuicultura, Facultad de Recursos Naturales, Universidad Católica de Temuco, Avenida Rudecindo Ortega 02950, Casilla 15D, 4780000 Temuco, Chile; Núcleo de Investigación en Producción Alimentaria, Escuela de Acuicultura, Facultad de Recursos Naturales, Universidad Católica de Temuco, Avenida Rudecindo Ortega 02950, Casilla 15D, 4780000 Temuco, Chile; Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Andrés Bello, Republica 217, 8370146 Santiago, Chile",Journal of Immunology Research

This work developed an integrated process based on capture of red mud (RM) and a one-step heat-treatment process to efficiently recover PGMs from spent auto-catalysts (SAC) and reuse RM simultaneously. Firstly, the iron oxide in RM was reduced to metallic iron to capture PGMs by the reduction process, without the addition of an extra reducing agent, since SAC contained abundant organic volatiles. Then, the mixed waste of SAC and RM was melted under high temperature with additives of CaO and H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>. More than 99% of PGMs can be extracted under the optimal conditions of 40–50 wt% of RM addition, 14 wt% of H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub> addition, 0.7–0.8 of basicity, 1500 °C of temperature, and 40 min of holding time. In addition, PGM content in obtained glassy slag was less than 1 g/t. The mechanism of iron trapping PGMs was also discussed in detailed, which mainly contained two stages: migration of PGMs and separation of PGM-bearing alloy and slag phases. Besides, the obtained glassy slag was further prepared into glass-ceramic by a one-step heat-treatment process. It was found that the prepared glass-ceramic has good thermostability and an excellent stabilizing effect on heavy metals. Overall, the results indicated that the developed integrated smelting–collection process is an efficient and promising method for the reutilization of SAC and RM.","School of Metallurgy, Northeastern University, Shenyang 110819, China; School of Metallurgy, Northeastern University, Shenyang 110819, China; School of Metallurgy, Northeastern University, Shenyang 110819, China; School of Metallurgy, Northeastern University, Shenyang 110819, China",Minerals

In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that propofol independently reduces migration of cancer cells and metastasis. Thus, the authors retrospectively examined the link between propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and recurrence or overall survival in patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy (MRM).MethodsA retrospective analysis of the electronic database of all patients undergoing MRM for breast cancer between January 2007 and December 2008 was undertaken. Patients received either propofol-based TIVA (propofol group) or sevoflurane-based anesthesia (sevoflurane group). We analyzed prognostic factors of breast cancer and perioperative factors and compared recurrence-free survival and overall survival between propofol and sevoflurane groups.ResultsA total of 363 MRMs were carried out during the period of the trial; 325 cases were suitable for analysis (173 cases of propofol group, and 152 cases of sevoflurane group). There were insignificant differences between the groups in age, weight, height, histopathologic results, surgical time, or postoperative treatment (chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and radiotherapy). The use of opioids during the perioperative period was greater in propofol group than in sevoflurane group. Overall survival was no difference between the two groups. Propofol group showed a lower rate of cancer recurrence (P = 0.037), with an estimated hazard ratio of 0.550 (95% CI 0.311–0.973).ConclusionsThis retrospective study provides the possibility that propofol-based TIVA for breast cancer surgery can reduce the risk of recurrence during the initial 5 years after MRM.","Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, Center for Breast Cancer, Korea Cancer Center Hospital, Seoul, Korea.; Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, Center for Breast Cancer, Korea Cancer Center Hospital, Seoul, Korea.; Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, Center for Breast Cancer, Korea Cancer Center Hospital, Seoul, Korea.; Department of General Surgery, Center for Breast Cancer, Korea Cancer Center Hospital, Seoul, Korea.; Department of Hemato-oncology, Veterans Health Service Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.",Korean Journal of Anesthesiology

Constructing a monovalent one-armed antibody has been reported to be an effective way to create an inhibitory anti-c-Met antibody.Materials and methods: In the present study, a novel monovalent one-armed anti-c-Met antibody was constructed using the knobs-into-holes technology, and its inhibitory effects against HCC and the underlying mechanisms were explored.Results: The one-armed anti-c-Met antibody blocked the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-Met interaction and the subsequent signal transduction, including phosphorylation of c-Met, Grb2-associated binding protein 1(Gab-1), extracellular regulated protein kinases 1/2(Erk1/2), and Akt, also referred to as protein kinase B (PKB) in HCC cell line HepG2. Furthermore, the autocrine stimulation of HepG2 cell proliferation and HGF-induced HCC cell migration were strongly inhibited by the one-armed anti-c-Met antibody. In addition, the antibody also reduced the HGF-induced proliferation and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Treating HepG2-bearing mice with the one-armed anti-c-Met antibody significantly inhibited the tumor growth in the xenograft nude mouse model.Conclusion: The one-armed anti-c-Met antibody derived from the full-length bivalent anti-c-Met antibody might serve as a potential antitumor agent against HCC.Keywords: antitumor, c-Met, hepatocellular carcinoma, knobs into holes, monovalent antibody, targeted therapy",NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN,"Drug Design, Development and Therapy"

Among the mediators of VSMC during atherosclerosis development, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB is a potent mitogen for VSMCs and greatly contributes to the intimal accumulation of VSMCs. <i>Glossogyne tenuifolia</i> (GT, Xiang-Ru) is a traditional antipyretic and hepatoprotective herb from Penghu Island, Taiwan. This study evaluated the inhibitory effect of GT ethanol extract (GTE) and GT water extract (GTW) on proliferative and migratory activities in PDGF-BB-induced VSMCs. The experimental results demonstrated that GTE significantly inhibited the PDGF-BB-stimulated VSMC proliferation and migration, as shown by MTT, wound healing, and Boyden chamber assays. GTE was found to have a much more potent inhibitory activity than GTW. Based on the Western blot analysis, GTE significantly blocked the PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38, and JNK, in VSMCs. In addition, GTE retarded the PDGF-BB-mediated migration through the suppression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 expression in VSMCs. Three main ingredients of GT—chlorogenic acid, luteolin-7-glucoside, and luteolin—all showed significant anti-proliferative effects on PDGF-BB-induced VSMCs. As a whole, our findings indicated that GTE has the potential to be a therapeutic agent to prevent or treat restenosis or atherosclerosis.","School of Medicine, College of Medicine, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung 82445, Taiwan; School of Medicine for International Students, College of Medicine, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung 82445, Taiwan; School of Medicine, College of Medicine, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung 82445, Taiwan; Department of Nutrition, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung 82445, Taiwan; School of Medicine, College of Medicine, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung 82445, Taiwan; Department of Nutrition, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung 82445, Taiwan; Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, E-Da Hospital/E-Da Dachang Hospital, Kaohsiung 82445, Taiwan; School of Medicine for International Students, College of Medicine, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung 82445, Taiwan",Molecules

This method, however, suffers from low sensitivity and specificty. Here, we developed a quantitative non-invasive in-vivo cell localization method using contrast enhanced multiparametric MRI and support vector machines (SVM) based post-processing. Imaging phantoms consisting of agarose with compartments containing different concentrations of cancer cells labeled with iron oxide nanoparticles were used to train and evaluate the SVM for cell localization. From the magnitude and phase data acquired with a series of T2*-weighted gradient-echo scans at different echo-times, we extracted features that are characteristic for the presence of superparamagnetic nanoparticles, in particular hyper- and hypointensities, relaxation rates, short-range phase perturbations, and perturbation dynamics. High detection quality was achieved by SVM analysis of the multiparametric feature-space. The in-vivo applicability was validated in animal studies. The SVM detected the presence of iron oxide nanoparticles in the imaging phantoms with high specificity and sensitivity with a detection limit of 30 labeled cells per mm3, corresponding to 19 μM of iron oxide. As proof-of-concept, we applied the method to follow the migration of labeled cancer cells injected in rats.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have recently been identified in exosomes, and exosomal circRNAs exert important biological activities in human cancers, including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether circRNA GDP dissociation inhibitor 2 (circGDI2) was transferred by exosomes and how exosomal circGDI2 regulated OSCC cell malignant behaviors.Methods: The levels of circGDI2, miR-424-5p and suppressor of cancer cell invasion (SCAI) were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) or Western blot. Cell proliferation was evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Transwell assays were performed to detect cell migration and invasion. Measurement of glucose consumption and lactate production were conducted using a corresponding assay kit. Targeted correlations among circGDI2, miR-424-5p and SCAI were confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assays. Xenograft assays were used to observe the role of circGDI2 in tumor growth in vivo.Results: Our data indicated that circGDI2 was down-regulated in OSCC, and it could be transferred by the exosomes in OSCC cells. The up-regulation of exosomal circGDI2 weakened OSCC cell proliferation, migration, invasion and glycolysis. CircGDI2 functioned as a molecular sponge of miR-424-5p, and SCAI was a direct target of miR-424-5p. MiR-424-5p mediated the repression of exosomal circGDI2 overexpression on OSCC cell malignant behaviors, and miR-424-5p silencing mitigated OSCC cell progression by up-regulating SCAI. Moreover, exosomal circGDI2 regulated SCAI expression through sponging miR-424-5p. Additionally, the overexpression of exosomal circGDI2 inhibited tumor growth in vivo.Conclusion: The present study had led to the identification of exosomal circGDI2 that regulated OSCC cell malignant behaviors through targeting the miR-424-5p/SCAI axis, highlighting circGDI2 as a novel exosome-based cancer biomarker and therapeutic agent for OSCC treatment.Keywords: OSCC, exosome, circGDI2, miR-424-5p, SCAI",NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN,Cancer Management and Research

113,Jasmin  Katrin Badawi,Bee Venom Components as Therapeutic Tools against Prostate Cancer,2021,"Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in men. Despite the development of a variety of therapeutic agents to treat either metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, advanced prostate cancer, or nonmetastatic/metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, the progression or spread of the disease often cannot be avoided. Additionally, the development of resistance of prostate cancer cells to available therapeutic agents is a well-known problem. Despite extensive and cost-intensive research over decades, curative therapy for metastatic prostate cancer is still not available. Therefore, additional therapeutic agents are still needed. The animal kingdom offers a valuable source of natural substances used for the treatment of a variety of diseases. Bee venom of the honeybee is a mixture of many components. It contains proteins acting as enzymes such as phospholipase A2, smaller proteins and peptides such as melittin and apamin, phospholipids, and physiologically active amines such as histamine, dopamine, and noradrenaline. Melittin has been shown to induce apoptosis in different cancer cell lines, including prostate cancer cell lines. It also influences cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and necrosis as well as motility, migration, metastasis, and invasion of tumour cells. Hence, it represents an interesting anticancer agent. In this review article, studies about the effect of bee venom components on prostate cancer cells are discussed. An electronic literature research was performed utilising PubMed in February 2021. All scientific publications, which examine this interesting subject, are discussed. Furthermore, the different types of application of these promising substances are outlined. The studies clearly indicate that bee venom or melittin exhibited anticancer effects in various prostate cancer cell lines and in xenografts. In most of the studies, a combination of bee venom or the modified melittin with another molecule was utilised in order to avoid side effects and, additionally, to target selectively the prostate cancer cells or the surrounding tissue. The studies showed that systemic side effects and unwanted damage to healthy tissue and organs could be minimised when the anticancer drug was not activated until binding to the cancer cells or the surrounding tissue. Different targets were used, such as the matrix metalloproteinase 2, hormone receptors expressed by prostate cancer cells, the extracellular domain of PSMA, and the fibroblast activation protein occurring in the stroma of prostate cancer cells. Another approach used loaded phosphate micelles, which were cleaved by the enzyme secretory phospholipase A2 produced by prostate cancer cells. In a totally different approach, targeted nanoparticles containing the melittin gene were used for prostate cancer gene therapy. By the targeted nonviral gene delivery, the gene encoding melittin was delivered to the prostate cancer cells without systemic side effects. This review of the scientific literature reveals totally different approaches using bee venom, melittin, modified melittin, or protoxin as anticancer agents. The toxic agents acted through several different mechanisms to produce their anti-prostate cancer effects.

The final materials are intended for contact with foodstuffs other than fatty foods for long‐term storage at room temperature including short heating. No thermal degradation of the substance is expected under manufacturing process conditions of polyolefins. Specific migration from low‐density polyethylene (LDPE) made with 0.37% of the substance into 3% acetic acid and 10% ethanol was up to 0.68 mg/kg. Based on negative results in a bacterial mutation test and in an in vivo micronucleus test, there was no evidence of a genotoxic potential of the substance. Impurities were determined and the main ones were tested in a bacterial mutation test giving negative results. Along with the negative results from the in vivo micronucleus test on the substance containing the impurities, there was no evidence of a genotoxic potential of the impurities. Based on a 28‐day study on the substance, the Panel noted that there is sufficient margin of safety between the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) and the maximum exposure of consumers that could occur at a migration level of 5 mg/kg food, to cover uncertainties about toxic effects due to potential accumulation of slowly hydrolysed branched amide species of the substance during chronic exposure. The CEF Panel concluded that the substance is not of safety concern for consumers if it is used in the manufacture of polyolefin articles intended for contact with all foodstuffs other than fatty foods and the migration does not exceed 5 mg/kg food.

The evolution of metastasis is a puzzle because a metastatic clone is at a disadvantage in competition for space and resources with non-metastatic clones in the primary tumor. Metastatic clones waste some of their reproductive potential on emigrating cells with little chance of establishing metastases. We suggest that resource heterogeneity within primary tumors selects for cell migration, and that cell emigration is a by-product of that selection.We developed an agent-based model to simulate the evolution of neoplastic cell migration. We simulated the essential dynamics of neoangiogenesis and blood vessel occlusion that lead to resource heterogeneity in neoplasms. We observed the probability and speed of cell migration that evolves with changes in parameters that control the degree of spatial and temporal resource heterogeneity. Across a broad range of realistic parameter values, increasing degrees of spatial and temporal heterogeneity select for the evolution of increased cell migration and emigration.We showed that variability in resources within a neoplasm (e.g. oxygen and nutrients provided by angiogenesis) is sufficient to select for cells with high motility. These cells are also more likely to emigrate from the tumor, which is the first step in metastasis and the key to the puzzle of metastasis. Thus, we have identified a novel potential solution to the puzzle of metastasis.",NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN,PLoS ONE

However, the important criterion was the availability of information about the testing of the constructed model on the actual data for a specific municipality. Foreign experience of application of the agent-oriented approach to the study of socio-economic systems of the meso-level is disclosed on the example of the models of municipalities that are the most interesting and promising from our point of view: these models are models of the virtual economy of the city, the model of interrelated markets for housing and land, the models of expansion of the city area, the models of reducing the city, the model of intra-city migration, the models of interconnected development of creative industries and spatial structure of the city.

However, there is still a dearth of formal models that allow us to investigate the observed short-term dynamics of microbiomes under a unified ecological and evolutionary framework. In our previous study, we developed a computational agent-based neutral framework that simulates microbiome dynamics spanning many host generations with the added dimension of a genealogy of hosts. Although this long-term framework revealed interesting microbial diversity patterns under a simple but plausible evolutionary process and provided a platform for future elaboration of more complex systems, it does not allow us to explore microbiome dynamics within a single host generation. Methods In this paper, we developed a computational, agent-based, forward-time framework of microbiome dynamics within a single host generation. As we have done under our neutral long-term models, we incorporate neutral processes of environmental microbiome assembly and microbe acquisition from parents and environment. We also incorporate a Moran genealogical model of hosts, so that the dynamics of microbiome evolution can be studied within a single host generation. Furthermore, we allow host subpopulation structure and host migration to affect microbiome recruitment. Results We show that microbiome diversity within hosts increases monotonically with increases in environmental contribution, while microbiome diversity between hosts increases with increasing parental inheritance. Host population division and dispersal limitation under high host contribution further shaped the patterns by elevating microbiome differences between hosts and depressing microbial diversity within hosts. Microbiome diversity within the whole population showed strong temporal stability regardless of the modes of microbiome acquisition and subpopulation structures. Conclusions We present a computational framework that integrates various processes including host genealogy, microbe recruitment, and host dispersal limitation acting on the short-term dynamics of microbiomes. Our framework demonstrates that the neutral dynamics of microbiomes within a population of hosts is strongly influenced by transmission mode and shared environment.","Department of Biology, Duke University; Research School of Biology, The Australian National University",Microbiome

The actin cytoskeleton undergoes significant reorganization in many different contexts, including during directed cell migration and over the course of the cell cycle, when cortical actin can transition between different configurations such as open patched meshworks, homogeneous distributions, and aligned bundles. Several types of myosin motor proteins, characterized by different kinetic parameters, have been involved in this reorganization of actin filaments. Given the limitations in studying the interactions of actin with myosin in vivo, we propose stochastic agent-based models and develop a set of data analysis measures to assess how myosin motor proteins mediate various actin organizations. In particular, we identify individual motor parameters, such as motor binding rate and step size, that generate actin networks with different levels of contractility and different patterns of myosin motor localization, which have previously been observed experimentally. In simulations where two motor populations with distinct kinetic parameters interact with the same actin network, we find that motors may act in a complementary way, by tuning the actin network organization, or in an antagonistic way, where one motor emerges as dominant. This modeling and data analysis framework also uncovers parameter regimes where spatial segregation between motor populations is achieved. By allowing for changes in kinetic rates during the actin-myosin dynamic simulations, our work suggests that certain actin-myosin organizations may require additional regulation beyond mediation by motor proteins in order to reconfigure the cytoskeleton network on experimentally-observed timescales.",NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN,PLoS Computational Biology

This work is focused on the identification of the conditions in which tumor cells can cross, by mechanical means, the basement membrane and invade the bladder lamina propria. It is demonstrated how specific mechanical properties of the cancer cells, as their stiffness and adhesion to neighboring cells, heavily determine the probability of transition from a non-invasive to an invasive tumor. In particular, it is shown how an increased cellular adhesion of tumor cells to neighbor cells and/or extracellular fibers drives a collective migration, increasing the tumor growth rate and its invasion capacity. It is proposed that these physical characteristics should be considered as potential therapeutic targets to control the tumor growth and its progress to a more dangerous condition.","Corresponding author.; Center of Physics of the University of Coimbra (CFisUC), Department of Physics, Coimbra, Portugal; Center of Physics of the University of Coimbra (CFisUC), Department of Physics, Coimbra, Portugal; Center of Physics of the University of Coimbra (CFisUC), Department of Physics, Coimbra, Portugal",Informatics in Medicine Unlocked

Ultimately, the public’s response to announcements of lockdowns—defined as restrictions on both local movement or long distance travel—will determine how effective these kinds of interventions are. Here, we evaluate the effects of lockdowns on human mobility and simulate how these changes may affect epidemic spread by analyzing aggregated mobility data from mobile phones. We show that in 2020 following lockdown announcements but prior to their implementation, both local and long distance movement increased in multiple locations, and urban-to-rural migration was observed around the world. To examine how these behavioral responses to lockdown policies may contribute to epidemic spread, we developed a simple agent-based spatial model. Our model shows that this increased movement has the potential to increase seeding of the epidemic in less urban areas, which could undermine the goal of the lockdown in preventing disease spread. Lockdowns play a key role in reducing contacts and controlling outbreaks, but appropriate messaging surrounding their announcement and careful evaluation of changes in mobility are needed to mitigate the possible unintended consequences.","Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

We analyse their geographical distances moved for a new affiliation and their age when moving, this way reconstructing their geographical “career paths”. These paths are used to derive the world network of scientists’ mobility between cities and to analyse its topological properties. We further develop and calibrate an agent-based model, such that it reproduces the empirical findings both at the level of scientists and of the global network. Our model takes into account that the academic hiring process is largely demand-driven and demonstrates that the probability of scientists to relocate decreases both with age and with distance.

Empirical data have repeatedly shown the bioregulatory importance of magnesium (Mg) ions in MSC growth and osteogenesis. In this study, we propose an agent-based model to predict the spatiotemporal dynamics of the MSC population and osteogenic differentiation in response to Mg2+ ions. A fuzzy-logic controller was designed to govern the decision-making process of cells by predicting four cellular processes of proliferation, differentiation, migration, and mortality in response to several important bioregulatory factors such as Mg2+ ions, pH, BMP2, and TGF-β1. The model was calibrated using the empirical data obtained from three sets of cell culture experiments. The model successfully reproduced the empirical observations regarding live cell count, viability, DNA content, and the differentiation-related markers of alkaline phosphate (ALP) and osteocalcin (OC). The simulation results, in agreement with the empirical data, showed that Mg2+ ions within 3–6 mM concentration have the highest stimulation effect on cell population growth. The model also correctly reproduced the stimulatory effect of Mg2+ ions on ALP and its inhibitory effect on OC as the early and late differentiation markers, respectively. Besides, the numerical simulation shed light on the innate cellular differences of the cells cultured in different experiments in terms of the proliferative capacity as well as sensitivity to Mg2+ ions. The proposed model can be adopted in the study of the osteogenesis around Mg-based implants where ions released due to degradation interact with local cells and regulate bone regeneration.","Corresponding author.; Helmholtz Zentrum Hereon, Institute of Metallic Biomaterials, Max-Planck-Straße 1, 21502 Geesthacht, Germany; Helmholtz Zentrum Hereon, Institute of Metallic Biomaterials, Max-Planck-Straße 1, 21502 Geesthacht, Germany; Helmholtz Zentrum Hereon, Institute of Metallic Biomaterials, Max-Planck-Straße 1, 21502 Geesthacht, Germany; Helmholtz Zentrum Hereon, Institute of Metallic Biomaterials, Max-Planck-Straße 1, 21502 Geesthacht, Germany; Helmholtz Zentrum Hereon, Institute of Metallic Biomaterials, Max-Planck-Straße 1, 21502 Geesthacht, Germany; Helmholtz Zentrum Hereon, Institute of Metallic Biomaterials, Max-Planck-Straße 1, 21502 Geesthacht, Germany",Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal

Recent studies revealed that CA has antiviral and anti-tumor effects. However, the effect and mechanism of CA on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) through whole transcriptome sequencing integrated analysis have not been systematically investigated. In this study, whole transcriptome sequencing was used to identify differentially expressed messenger RNAs (mRNAs), micro RNAs (miRNAs), and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were influenced by CA and screen regulatory pathways. The results showed that CA significantly inhibited proliferation, invasion, and migration, whereas it induced the apoptosis of NSCLC cells. CA inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis revealed that these differentially expressed mRNAs were potentially implicated in the CA-suppressing malignant phenotypes of NSCLC. According to the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis, a ceRNA network was constructed, including 13 mRNAs, 6 miRNAs, and 11 lncRNAs. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis of the 13 mRNAs in the ceRNA network showed that suppressors of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), BTG anti-proliferation factor 2 (BTG2), and Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) were significantly enriched in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, RNA degradation, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway related to cancer. These findings indicated that SOCS1, BTG2, and BTK play an essential role in CA against NSCLC. Meanwhile, based on the ceRNA network, three lncRNAs (long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 1504 [LINC01504], LINC01783, and THUMPD3 antisense RNA 1 [THUMPD3-AS1]) and three miRNAs (has-miR-155-5p, has-miR-7-5p, and has-miR-425-5p) associated with SOCS1, BTG2, and BTK may be important in CA against NSCLC.

The early immune response in human blood comprises the elimination of pathogens by antimicrobial peptides and innate immune cells, such as neutrophils or monocytes. Mathematical modeling is a predictive method to examine these complex processes and to quantify the dynamics of pathogen-host interactions. Since model parameters are often not directly accessible from experiment, their estimation is required by calibrating model predictions with experimental data. Depending on the complexity of the mathematical model, parameter estimation can be associated with excessively high computational costs in terms of run time and memory. We apply a strategy for reliable parameter estimation where different modeling approaches with increasing complexity are used that build on one another. This bottom-up modeling approach is applied to an experimental human whole-blood infection assay for Candida albicans. Aiming for the quantification of the relative impact of different routes of the immune response against this human-pathogenic fungus, we start from a non-spatial state-based model (SBM), because this level of model complexity allows estimating textit{a priori} unknown transition rates between various system states by the global optimization method simulated annealing. Building on the non-spatial SBM, an agent-based model (ABM) is implemented that incorporates the migration of interacting cells in three-dimensional space. The ABM takes advantage of estimated parameters from the non-spatial SBM, leading to a decreased dimensionality of the parameter space.

We have recently described a computer-based drug design for a small molecule VEGFR2 inhibitor named VH02 (1-((1-(1H-indazol-6-yl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl)-3-(3-chloromethylphenyl)urea). This study aimed to further explore the anti-angiogenic activity of VH02 both in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro assays include cell viability, capillary-like tube formation, MMP activity, and western blot analyses of signaling through VEGFR2 while the in vivo anti-angiogenic response were performed to evaluate the effect on vascularization in Matrigel plug applied in C57BL/6L mice. VH02 reduced angiogenesis behavior of EA.hy926 including cell viability, migration, adhesion, capillary-like tube formation, and MMP-2 activity induced by VEGF. Furthermore, VH02 regulated angiogenesis by directly inhibiting VEGFR2 on Tyr1175 signaling pathway leading to the inhibition of Akt-mediated cell survival and migration. Disruption of phosphorylation at VEGFR2-Tyr1175 by VH02 abolished FAK-Tyr397 signaling but not phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. This suggests that blockade of FAK by VH02 apparently associated with reduction of endothelial cell motility. Actin cytoskeleton rearrangement was diminished by VH02 in human endothelial cells. The anti-angiogenic effect of VH02 was confirmed in the in vivo model, revealing the reduction of vascular density in Matrigel plug after VH02 treatment.

By combining drugs with different mechanisms of action, the limitations of each individual agent can be overcome, while increasing therapeutic benefit. Here, we propose employing tumor-migrating decidua-derived mesenchymal stromal cells as therapeutic agents combining antiangiogenic therapy and chemotherapy. First, a plasmid encoding the antiangiogenic protein endostatin was transfected into these cells by nucleofection, confirming its expression by ELISA and its biological effect in an ex ovo chick embryo model. Second, doxorubicin-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles were introduced into the cells, which would act as vehicles for the drug being released. The effect of the drug was evaluated in a coculture in vitro model with mammary cancer cells. Third, the combination of endostatin transfection and doxorubicin-nanoparticle loading was carried out with the decidua mesenchymal stromal cells. This final cell platform was shown to retain its tumor-migration capacity in vitro, and the combined in vitro therapeutic efficacy was confirmed through a 3D spheroid coculture model using both cancer and endothelial cells. The results presented here show great potential for the development of combination therapies based on genetically-engineered cells that can simultaneously act as cellular vehicles for drug-loaded nanoparticles.","Grupo de Medicina Regenerativa, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Hospital 12 de Octubre (imas12), Avda.

To understand how these events dynamically shape gradients and influence ensuing cell chemotaxis, we built a multi-scale hybrid agent-based model linking gradient formation, cell responses, and receptor-level information. The CXCL12/CXCR4/CXCR7 signaling axis is highly implicated in metastasis of many cancers. We model CXCL12 gradient formation as it is impacted by CXCR4 and CXCR7, with particular focus on the three most highly expressed isoforms of CXCL12. We trained and validated our model using data from an in vitro microfluidic source-sink device. Our simulations demonstrate how isoform differences on the molecular level affect gradient formation and cell responses. We determine that ligand properties specific to CXCL12 isoforms (binding to the migration surface and to CXCR4) significantly impact migration and explain differences in in vitro chemotaxis data. We extend our model to analyze CXCL12 gradient formation in a tumor environment and find that short distance, steep gradients characteristic of the CXCL12-γ isoform are effective at driving chemotaxis. We highlight the importance of CXCL12-γ in cancer cell migration: its high effective affinity for both extracellular surface sites and CXCR4 strongly promote CXCR4+ cell migration. CXCL12-γ is also more difficult to inhibit, and we predict that co-inhibition of CXCR4 and CXCR7 is necessary to effectively hinder CXCL12-γ-induced migration. These findings support the growing importance of understanding differences in protein isoforms, and in particular their implications for cancer treatment.",NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN,PLoS ONE

The state&#8217;s salmon fisheries support recreational, subsistence, and commercial harvest with multiple billions of dollars flowing into the economy, and define the cultural identity of many Alaskans. Fishery management practices rely on historic records to set policies with two goals: to meet salmon escapement quota and to maximize salmon harvest. At the same time, rapid social and ecological changes to the sub-Arctic are already impacting salmon runs and fisheries management. Combined with the inability of fishery managers to test the outcome of proposed policy changes, an understanding of the role social and ecological drivers play in harvest and effort is required. To address the two-forked problem of understanding socio-ecological dynamics and potential policy responses to ecological and social changes, we (1) conducted stakeholder workshops to solicit key system drivers, (2) built an integrated agent based model (ABM) of the system&#8217;s socio-ecological dynamics, and (3) tested the impacts of alternative future scenarios of ecological, social, and policy changes on the system&#8217;s outcomes. We previously constructed and validated a high-fidelity, data-driven, agent-based model of the Kenai River, Alaska that simulates seasonal harvest of sockeye and Chinook salmon, the fishing activities of the personal use fishery, commercial drift, and set gillnet agents. We study the role of key stakeholder and ecological drivers, using the ABM decision support tool, and their implications for fisheries management policies. Analysis of the scenario based studies found resilience in management of commercial fisheries to changing salmon migration dynamics, a lack of adaptive capacity in recreational (personal use) dipnet users to altered sockeye salmon runs, and the possible utility of introducing management measures in the dipnet fishery to manipulate sockeye escapement levels. These findings represent the usefulness of this type of ABM in assisting fishery managers everywhere in investigating possible future outcomes of different management or ecological scenarios.","Software Engineer, General Communications Inc., Anchorage, AK 99503, USA ; Computer Science, University of Portland, Portland, OR 97203, USA; Environmental Science and Policy, Southern Oregon University, Ashland, OR 97520, USA",Fishes

Under MTT assay, we found that brazilein revealed cytotoxic effect on 4T1 cells in a dose­dependent manner (IC50=50 ± 0.3 µM). Combination of brazilein and cisplatin showed synergistic effect (CI=0.72). Flowcytometry analysis on the cell cycle progression showed that single treatment of 25 µM brazilein induced G2/M­phase accumulation, 12.5 µM cisplatin induced S­phase accumulation, while combination of brazilein and cisplatin induced S­phase and G2/Mphase accumulation. Combination of brazilein and cisplatin induced apoptosis higher than that of the single treatments. Based on wound healing assay, 12.5 µM brazilein and its combination with 6.25 µM cisplatin inhibited cells migration. Immunoblotting and gelatin zymography analysis showed that combination of brazilein and cisplatin inhibited the expression level of Rac1 and MMP9 proteins.

Thus, there is a constant need to develop alternative anticancer drugs. Sustainable supply is an important challenge facing marine-based drug discovery. Primmorph, a 3D cell culture system, could provide a sustainable source to produce metabolites for anticancer drugs from marine sponges. In the present work, the anticancer activity of primmorph extracts and mesohyls of Negombata magnifica, Hemimycle arabica, Crella spinulata, and Stylissa carteri sponges was evaluated. Antiproliferative activity was studied in terms of cytotoxicity, colony formation, cell cycle, and apoptosis. Migration was assessed by migration assay and matrix metalloproteinase activity. The expression of proliferation and migration-related genes was analyzed using real time PCR. Migration and proliferation activities of HepG2 cells were inhibited by treatment with primmorph extracts and mesohyls of N. magnifica, H. arabica, and C. spinulata. The mesohyl of S. carteri did not show any anticancer activity although the primmorph extract led to cell cycle arrest. Among the selected sponge species, the primmorph extract of C. spinulata was the most promising anticancer agent regarding antiproliferative and antimigratory activities.

The pharmacological inhibition of the miR-130 family molecules by the seed-targeting strategy with an 8-mer tiny locked nucleic acid (LNA) inhibits the growth, migration, and invasion of bladder cancer cells by repressing stress fiber formation. Here, we searched for a functionally advanced target sequence with LNA for the miR-130 family with low cytotoxicity and found LNA #9 (A(L)^i^i^A(L)^T(L)^T(L)^G(L)^5(L)^A(L)^5(L)^T(L)^G) as a candidate LNA. LNA #9 inhibited cell growth in vitro and in an in vivo orthotopic bladder cancer model. Proteome-wide tyrosine phosphorylation analysis suggested that the miR-130 family upregulates a wide range of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) signaling via the expression of phosphorylated Src (pSrc<sup>Tyr416</sup>). SILAC-based proteome analysis and a luciferase assay identified protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 1 (PTPN1), which is implicated as a negative regulator of multiple signaling pathways downstream of RTKs as a target gene of the miR-130 family. The miR-130-targeted LNA increased and decreased PTPN1 and pSrc<sup>Tyr416</sup> expressions, respectively. PTPN1 knockdown led to increased tumor properties (cell growth, invasion, and migration) and increased pSrc<sup>Tyr416</sup> expression in bladder cancer cells, suggesting that the miR-130 family upregulates multiple RTK signaling by targeting PTPN1 and subsequent Src activation in bladder cancer.

Bernabeu",Traffic Patterns of the Migrating Endothelium: How Force Transmission Regulates Vascular Malformation and Functional Shunting During Angiogenic Remodelling,2022,"Angiogenesis occurs in distinct phases: initial spouting is followed by remodelling in which endothelial cells (ECs) composing blood vessels rearrange by migrating against the direction of flow. Abnormal remodelling can result in vascular malformation. Such is the case in mutation of the Alk1 receptor within the mouse retina which disrupts flow-migration coupling, creating mixed populations of ECs polarised with/against flow which aggregate into arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The lack of live imaging options in vivo means that the collective EC dynamics that drive AVM and the consequences of mixed populations of polarity remain a mystery. Therefore, our goal is to present a novel agent-based model to provide theoretical insight into EC force transmission and collective dynamics during angiogenic remodelling. Force transmission between neighbouring agents consists of extrusive forces which maintain spacing and cohesive forces which maintain the collective. We performed migration simulations within uniformly polarised populations (against flow) and mixed polarity (with/against flow). Within uniformly polarised populations, extrusive forces stabilised the plexus by facilitating EC intercalation which ensures that cells remained evenly distributed. Excess cohesion disrupts intercalation, resulting in aggregations of cells and functional shunting. Excess cohesion between ECs prevents them from resolving diameter balances within the plexus, leading to prolonged flow reversals which exert a critical behaviour change within the system as they switch the direction of cell migration and traffic patterns at bifurcations. Introducing mixtures of cell polarity dramatically changed the role of extrusive forces within the system. At low extrusion, opposing ECs were able to move past each other; however, at high extrusion the pushing between cells resulted in migration speeds close to zero, forming traffic jams and disrupting migration. In our study, we produced vascular malformations and functional shunting with either excess cohesion between ECs or mixtures of cell polarity. At the centre of both these mechanisms are cell-cell adherens junctions, which are involved in flow sensing/polarity and must remodelling dynamically to allow rearrangements of cells during vascular patterning. Thus, our findings implicate junctional dysfunction as a new target in the treatment and prevention of vascular disease and AVMs.","Centre for Medical Informatics, Usher Institute, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom; Cardiovascular Research Center Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, United States; School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; Cardiovascular Research Center Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, United States; Yale University School of Medicine, Department of Cellular and Molecular Physiology, New Haven, CT, United States; Université de Paris, PARCC, INSERM, Paris, France; Centre for Medical Informatics, Usher Institute, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom; The Bayes Centre, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom",Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology

Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) are highly metastatic and are devoid of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification. TNBCs are unresponsive to Herceptin and/or anti-estrogen therapies and too often become highly chemoresistant when exposed to standard chemotherapy. TNBCs frequently metastasize to the lung and brain. We have previously shown that TNBCs are active for oncogenic Wnt10b/β-catenin signaling and that WNT10B ligand and its downstream target HMGA2 are predictive of poorer outcomes and are strongly associated with chemoresistant TNBC metastatic disease. In search of new chemicals to target the oncogenic WNT10B/β-CATENIN/HMGA2 signaling axis, the anti-proliferative activity of the diterpene Jatrophone (JA), derived from the plant Jatropha isabelli, was tested on TNBC cells. JA interfered with the WNT TOPFLASH reporter at the level between receptor complex and β-catenin activation. JA efficacy was determined in various subtypes of TNBC conventional cell lines or in TNBC cell lines derived from TNBC PDX tumors. The differential IC50 (DCI50) responsiveness was compared among the TNBC models based on etiological-subtype and their cellular chemoresistance status. Elevated WNT10B expression also coincided with increased resistance to JA exposure in several metastatic cell lines. JA interfered with cell cycle progression, and induced loss of expression of the canonical Wnt-direct targets genes AXIN2, HMGA2, MYC, PCNA and CCND1. Mechanistically, JA reduced steady-state, non-phosphorylated (activated) β-catenin protein levels, but not total β-catenin levels. JA also caused the loss of expression of key EMT markers and significantly impaired wound healing in scratch assays, suggesting a direct role for JA inhibiting migration of TNBC cells.

The effects of orally administered branaplam were evaluated in the SMA neonatal mouse model (SMNΔ7), and in juvenile Wistar Hannover rats and Beagle dogs. Histopathological examination and complementary immunohistochemical studies focused on areas of neurogenesis in the cerebellum (mice, rats, and dogs), and the subventricular zone of the striatum and dentate gyrus (rats and dogs) using antibodies directed against Ki67, phosphorylated histone H3, cleaved caspase-3, and glial fibrillary acidic protein. Additionally, image-analysis based quantification of calbindin-D28k and Ki67 was performed in rats and dogs. The patterns of cell proliferation and apoptosis, and neural migration and innervation in the cerebellum and other brain regions of active adult neurogenesis did not differ between branaplam- and control-treated animals. Quantitative image analysis did not reveal any changes in calbindin-D28k and Ki67 expression in rats and dogs. The data show that orally administered branaplam has no impact on neurogenesis in juvenile animals. Application of selected immunohistochemical stainings in combination with quantitative image analysis on a few critical areas of postnatal CNS development offer a reliable approach to assess DNT of CNS-active drug candidates in juvenile animal toxicity studies.","

If the local dynamic at the subpopulation level is extinction-prone, the system viability is maximal at intermediate connectivity where recolonization is allowed, but full synchronization that enables correlated extinction is forbidden. Here we developed and used an algorithm for agent-based simulations in order to study the persistence of a stochastic metapopulation. The effect of noise is shown to be dramatic, and the dynamics of the spatial population differs substantially from the predictions of deterministic models. This has been validated for the stochastic versions of the logistic map, the Ricker map and the Nicholson-Bailey host-parasitoid system. To analyze the possibility of extinction, previous studies were focused on the attractiveness (Lyapunov exponent) of stable solutions and the structure of their basin of attraction (dependence on initial population size). Our results suggest that these features are of secondary importance in the presence of stochasticity. Instead, optimal sustainability is achieved when decoherence is maximal. Individual-based simulations of metapopulations of different sizes, dimensions and noise types, show that the system's lifetime peaks when it displays checkerboard spatial patterns. This conclusion is supported by the results of a recently published Drosophila experiment. The checkerboard strategy provides a technique for the manipulation of migration rates (e.g., by constructing corridors) in order to affect the persistence of a metapopulation. It may be used in order to minimize the risk of extinction of an endangered species, or to maximize the efficiency of an eradication campaign.",NaN; NaN; NaN,PLoS Computational Biology

Since GBM harbors genomic alterations in cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), targeting these structures with specific inhibitors (CDKis) is promising. Here, we describe the antitumoral potential of selective CDKi on low-passage GBM 2D- and 3D models, cultured as neurospheres (NSCs) or glioma stem-like cells (GSCs). By applying selective CDK4/6i abemaciclib and palbociclib, and the more global CDK1/2/5/9-i dinaciclib, different effects were seen. Abemaciclib and dinaciclib significantly affected viability in 2D- and 3D models with clearly visible changes in morphology. Palbociclib had weaker and cell line-specific effects. Motility and invasion were highly affected. Abemaciclib and dinaciclib additionally induced senescence. Also, mitochondrial dysfunction and generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) were seen. While autophagy was predominantly visible after abemaciclib treatment, dinaciclib evoked γ-H2AX-positive double-strand breaks that were boosted by radiation. Notably, dual administration of dinaciclib and abemaciclib yielded synergistic effects in most cases, but the simultaneous combination with standard chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide (TMZ) was antagonistic. RNA-based microarray analysis showed that gene expression was significantly altered by dinaciclib: genes involved in cell-cycle regulation (different CDKs and their cyclins, SMC3), mitosis (PLK1, TTK), transcription regulation (IRX3, MEN1), cell migration/division (BCAR1), and E3 ubiquitination ligases (RBBP6, FBXO32) were downregulated, whereas upregulation was seen in genes mediating chemotaxis (CXCL8, IL6, CCL2), and DNA-damage or stress (EGR1, ARC, GADD45A/B). In a long-term experiment, resistance development was seen in 1/5 cases treated with dinaciclib, but this could be prevented by abemaciclib. Vice versa, adding TMZ abrogated therapeutic effects of dinaciclib and growth was comparable to controls. With this comprehensive analysis, we confirm the therapeutic activity of selective CDKi in GBM. In addition to the careful selection of individual drugs, the timing of each combination partner needs to be considered to prevent resistance.","University Children’s Hospital, Rostock University Medical Centre; Core Facility for Microarray Analysis, Institute for Immunology, Rostock University Medical Centre; Institute of Pathology, Strempelstraße 14, 18055 Rostock, Rostock University Medical Centre; University Children’s Hospital, Rostock University Medical Centre; University Children’s Hospital, Rostock University Medical Centre; University Children’s Hospital, Rostock University Medical Centre; Department of Medicine Clinic III - Hematology, Oncology, Palliative Medicine, Rostock University Medical Center, Rostock University Medical Centre",Cell Death Discovery

PTEN is a major negative regulator of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Most human gliomas show high levels of activated Akt, whereas less than half of these tumors carry PTEN mutations or homozygous deletions. The unique ability of mesenchymal stem cells to track down tumor cells makes them as potential therapeutic agents. Based on this capability, new therapeutic approaches have been developed using mesenchymal stem cells to cure glioblastoma. However, molecular mechanisms of interactions between glioma cells and stem cells are still unknown.<h4>Methodology/principal findings</h4>In order to study the mechanisms by which migration of glioma cells can be inhibited by the upregulation of the PTEN gene, we studied two glioma cell lines (SNB19 and U251) and two glioma xenograft cell lines (4910 and 5310) alone and in co-culture with human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCBSC). Co-cultures of glioma cells showed increased expression of PTEN as evaluated by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting assays. Upregulation of PTEN gene is correlated with the downregulation of many genes including Akt, JUN, MAPK14, PDK2, PI3K, PTK2, RAS and RAF1 as revealed by cDNA microarray analysis. These results have been confirmed by reverse-transcription based PCR analysis of PTEN and Akt genes. Upregulation of PTEN resulted in the inhibition of migration capability of glioma cells under in vitro conditions. Also, wound healing capability of glioma cells was significantly inhibited in co-culture with hUCBSC. Under in vivo conditions, intracranial tumor growth was inhibited by hUCBSC in nude mice. Further, hUCBSC upregulated PTEN and decreased the levels of XIAP and Akt, which are responsible for the inhibition of tumor growth in the mouse brain.<h4>Conclusions/significance</h4>Our studies indicated that upregulation of PTEN by hUCBSC in glioma cells and in the nude mice tumors downregulated Akt and PI3K signaling pathway molecules. This resulted in the inhibition of migration as well as wound healing property of the glioma cells. Taken together, our results suggest hUCBSC as a therapeutic agent in treating malignant gliomas.",NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN,PLoS ONE

In these cells, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the ability of self-renewal and being differentiated into different types of cells, such as cardiovascular cells. Moreover, MSCs have low immunogenicity and immunomodulatory properties, and can protect the myocardium, which are ideal qualities for cardiovascular repair. Transplanting mesenchymal stem cells has demonstrated improved outcomes for treating cardiovascular diseases in preclinical trials. However, there still are some challenges, such as their low rate of migration to the ischemic myocardium, low tissue retention, and low survival rate after the transplantation. To solve these problems, an ideal method should be developed to precisely and quantitatively monitor the viability of the transplanted cells in vivo for providing the guidance of clinical translation. Cell imaging is an ideal method, but requires a suitable contrast agent to label and track the cells. This article reviews the uses of nanoparticles as contrast agents for tracking MSCs and the challenges of clinical use of MSCs in the potential treatment of cardiovascular diseases.","Emergency Department, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China; Guangdong Key Laboratory for Biomedical Measurements and Ultrasound Imaging, School of Biomedical Engineering, Shenzhen University, Health Science Center, Shenzhen, China; Emergency Department, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China; Advanced Materials Institute, Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, China; Advanced Materials Institute, Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, China; Emergency Department, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China",Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology

Treatment with chemotherapy has variable response rates leading to most dogs succumbing to their disease within a year. Cannabidiol is an emerging treatment within the field of oncology. In reported in vivo studies, cannabidiol has induced apoptosis, reduced cell migration, and acted as a chemotherapy sensitizer in various human tumor types. The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of cannabidiol on canine urothelial carcinoma cell viability and apoptosis as both a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy in vitro.<h4>Results</h4>Cannabidiol reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis in canine urothelial cells as determined by crystal violet viability assay and annexin V/propidium iodide flow cytometry. Furthermore, combinations of cannabidiol with mitoxantrone and vinblastine chemotherapy yielded significantly reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis compared to single agent treatment alone. The drug interactions were deemed synergistic based on combination index calculations. Conversely, the combination of cannabidiol and carboplatin did not result in decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis compared to single agent treatment. Combination index calculations suggested an antagonistic interaction between these drugs. Finally, the combination of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug piroxicam with cannabidiol did not significantly affect cell viability, although, some cell lines demonstrated decreased cell viability when mitoxantrone was combined with piroxicam.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Cannabidiol showed promising results as a single agent or in combination with mitoxantrone and vinblastine for treatment of canine urothelial carcinoma cells.

We are interested in isolating the naturally-derived small-molecule inhibitor that could simultaneously targeting TGFβ/BMP pathways and further studying its anti-proliferative/−metastatic effects as well as the underlying mechanisms in multiple tumor models. Methods Multiple in vitro cell-based assays are used to examine the compound’s inhibitory efficacy on TNBC cell growth, stemness, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion and migration by targeting TGFβ/BMP signaling pathways. Transgenic breast cancer mouse model (MMTV-PyMT), subcutaneous xenograft and bone metastasis models are used to examine ZL170’s effects on TNBC growth and metastasis potentials in vivo. Results ZL170 dose-dependently inhibits cell proliferation, EMT, stemness, invasion and migration in vitro via specifically targeting canonical TGFβ/BMP-SMADs pathways in TNBC cells. The compound significantly hinders osteolytic bone metastasis and xenograft tumor growth without inflicting toxicity on vital organs of tumor-bearing nude mice. ZL170 strongly inhibits primary tumor growth and lung metastases in MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice. ZL170-treated tumors exhibit impaired TGFβ/BMP signaling pathways in both epithelial and stromal compartments, thereby creating a suppressive tumor microenvironment characterized by reduced extracellular matrix deposition and decreased infiltration of stromal cells. Conclusions ZL170 inhibits tumor EMT, stemness and metastasis and could be further developed as a potent anti-metastatic agent used in combination with cytotoxic drugs for treatment of TNBC and other advanced metastatic cancers.","State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 211198, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Gannan Oil-Tea Camellia Industrial Development, Gannan Medical University; State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 211198, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Gannan Oil-Tea Camellia Industrial Development, Gannan Medical University; Guangdong Key Laboratory for Genome Stability & Disease Prevention, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shenzhen University Health Science Center; State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 211198, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Gannan Oil-Tea Camellia Industrial Development, Gannan Medical University; State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 211198, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Gannan Oil-Tea Camellia Industrial Development, Gannan Medical University; State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 211198, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Gannan Oil-Tea Camellia Industrial Development, Gannan Medical University; Guangdong Key Laboratory for Genome Stability & Disease Prevention, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shenzhen University Health Science Center; State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 211198, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Gannan Oil-Tea Camellia Industrial Development, Gannan Medical University",Journal of Experimental & Clinical Cancer Research

The question of how a capacity for adaptive migrations influences the success of a microbial population in various conditions is a challenge addressed in this study. We employed the agent-based model of competition of motile and sedentary microbial populations in a confined aquatic environment supplied with a periodic batch nutrient source to assess the fitness of both. Such factors as nutrient concentration in a batch, batch period, mortality type and energetic costs of migration were considered to determine the conditions favouring different strategies: Nomad of a motile population and Settler of a sedentary one. The modelling results demonstrate that dynamic and nutrient-scarce environments favour motile populations, whereas nutrient-rich and stagnant environments promote sedentary microorganisms. Energetic costs of migration determine whether or not the Nomad strategy of the motile population is successful, though it also depends on such conditions as nutrient availability. Even without penalties for migration, under certain conditions, the sedentary Settler population dominates in the ecosystem. It is achieved by decreasing the local nutrient availability near the nutrient source, as motile populations relying on a local optimizing strategy tend to follow benign conditions and fail, enduring stress associated with crossing the valleys of suboptimal nutrient availability.","Systems Biology Department, Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science, Lavrentiev Avenue 10, 630090 Novosibirsk, Russia; Systems Biology Department, Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science, Lavrentiev Avenue 10, 630090 Novosibirsk, Russia; Systems Biology Department, Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science, Lavrentiev Avenue 10, 630090 Novosibirsk, Russia; Systems Biology Department, Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science, Lavrentiev Avenue 10, 630090 Novosibirsk, Russia",Biology

This disease is uniformly fatal, with intratumor heterogeneity the major reason for treatment failure and recurrence. Just like the nature vs nurture debate, heterogeneity can arise from intrinsic or environmental influences. Whilst it is impossible to clinically separate observed behavior of cells from their environmental context, using a mathematical framework combined with multiscale data gives us insight into the relative roles of variation from different sources. To better understand the implications of intratumor heterogeneity on therapeutic outcomes, we created a hybrid agent-based mathematical model that captures both the overall tumor kinetics and the individual cellular behavior. We track single cells as agents, cell density on a coarser scale, and growth factor diffusion and dynamics on a finer scale over time and space. Our model parameters were fit utilizing serial MRI imaging and cell tracking data from ex vivo tissue slices acquired from a growth-factor driven glioblastoma murine model. When fitting our model to serial imaging only, there was a spectrum of equally-good parameter fits corresponding to a wide range of phenotypic behaviors. When fitting our model using imaging and cell scale data, we determined that environmental heterogeneity alone is insufficient to match the single cell data, and intrinsic heterogeneity is required to fully capture the migration behavior. The wide spectrum of in silico tumors also had a wide variety of responses to an application of an anti-proliferative treatment. Recurrent tumors were generally less proliferative than pre-treatment tumors as measured via the model simulations and validated from human GBM patient histology. Further, we found that all tumors continued to grow with an anti-migratory treatment alone, but the anti-proliferative/anti-migratory combination generally showed improvement over an anti-proliferative treatment alone.

Given that high quantities of dephosphorization agent are needed to obtain low phosphorus reduced iron, a novel approach is proposed by the authors. Without prior phosphorus removal, the phosphorus was enriched in the reduced iron during a reduction process, then high-phosphorus reduced iron was refined to low phosphorus molten iron and high phosphorus dephosphorization slag to be used as a phosphate fertilizer. The influences of various parameters, including the reduction temperature, the reduction time, and the C/O molar ratio, on the reaction behavior of phosphorus during reduction process were studied. Experimental results indicate that a higher reduction temperature, a longer reduction time, or a higher C/O molar ratio was favorable for the reduction of apatite to phosphorus and the enrichment of phosphorus in reduced iron. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis demonstrated that the apatite was reduced to phosphorus and Ca2SiO4 (or Ca(Al2Si2O8)) in the presence of SiO2 and Al2O3, whilst the phosphorus enriched in reduced iron formed Fe3P. The migration behavior of phosphorus was investigated using line scanning analysis of reduction products at different reduction times. The results show that the phosphorus primarily existed in the slag phase 10 min before reduction, and a large amount of phosphorus migrated into iron phase from slag phase with a reduction time of 40 min. The phosphorus content in the iron phase only slightly changed after 50 min. The pre-dephosphorization of reduced iron was performed at 1873 K, indicating a higher basicity or FetO content of CaO-based slag was beneficial to dephosphorization of the reduced iron.","College of Resources and Civil Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang 110819, China; College of Resources and Civil Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang 110819, China; College of Resources and Civil Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang 110819, China; College of Resources and Civil Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang 110819, China",Metals

The use of this powder as a suitable additive in tyre compounds is very important from economic and environmental viewpoints.Methods: Morphology of the water jet powder was investigated using SEM. The rubber powder was added to a SBR/BR-based tyre tread formulation and the curing behavior and mechanical properties of the resultant product were determined. A full factorial experimental design was also conducted to study simultaneously the effects of rubber powder, sulfur and carbon black levels on the curing and mechanical properties of tyre tread formulation. Furthermore, the modification effect of Vestenamer additive and curing agent on the formulation properties was investigated. When using design of experiments, for each property the regression models with linear and binary interaction terms on the basis of three variables were successfully developed and statistically validated.Findings: The rubber powder showed a lowering effect on tensile properties, which was attributed to reduced crosslink density due to the sulfur migration from the rubber matrix to the powder phase. A small, but statistically significant negative effect on the aging, abrasion and resilience properties of rubber compound was also observed, However, the tear resistance and de Mattia crack growth were improved with increasing rubber powder content, that could be attributed to the lesser effect of rubber powder on the compound modulus. It was shown that with some increase in the curing agent, sulfur and accelerator dosage, it was possible to compensate for the tensile properties to some extent and for the abrasion, resilience and aging properties completely, whereas others remained relatively unchanged. It was also shown that except for abrasion, the Vestenamer processing aid had little improving effect in the presence of rubber powder.","Department of Chemical Engineering, Birjand University of Technology, Postal Code: 971-9866981, Birjand, Iran; 2.

Based on these results some role of Spongionella compounds on other steps of the signalling pathway mediated by this chemotactic agent can be hypothesised. In the present paper we studied the effect of these four compounds on the surface membrane CD147 receptor expression, on the extracellular levels of Cyp A and on the ability to migrate of concanavalin (Con A)-activated T lymphocytes. Similarly to a well-known immunosuppressive agent cyclosporine A (CsA), Gracilin H, A, L and tetrahydroaplysulphurin-1 were able to reduce the CD147 membrane expression and to block the release of Cyp A to the medium. Besides, by using Cyp A as chemotactic agent, T cell migration was inhibited when cells were previously incubated with Gracilin A and Gracilin L.

Bradbury",The Role of Modeling in Monarch Butterfly Research and Conservation,2019,"Models are an integral part of the scientific endeavor, whether they be conceptual, mathematical, statistical, or simulation models. Models of appropriate complexity facilitate comprehension and improve understanding of the variables driving system processes. In the context of conservation planning decision-making or research efforts, a useful model can aid interpretation and avoid overfitting by including only essential elements. Models can serve two related, but different purposes: understanding and prediction of future system behavior. Predictive models can require several iterations of refinement and empirical data gathering to be useful for conservation planning. Models with less predictive ability can be used to enhance understanding of system function and generate hypotheses for empirical evaluation. Modeling monarch butterfly systems, whether it be landscape-scale movement in breeding habitats, migratory behavior, or population dynamics at monthly or yearly timeframes, is challenging because the systems encompass complex spatial and temporal interactions across nested scales that are difficult, if not impossible, to empirically observe or comprehend without simplification. We review mathematical, statistical, and simulation models that have provided insights into monarch butterfly systems. Mathematical models have provided understanding of underlying processes that may be driving monarch systems. Statistical models have provided understanding of patterns in empirical data, which may represent underlying mechanisms. Simulations models have provided understanding of mechanisms driving systems and provide the potential to link mechanisms with data to build more predictive models. As an example, recently published agent-based models of non-migratory eastern North American monarch butterfly movement and egg-laying may provide the means to explore how different spatial patterns of habitat, habitat quality, and the interaction of stressors can influence future adult recruitment. The migratory process, however, has not been addressed with agent-based modeling. Using western monarch migration as an example, we describe how modeling could be used to provide insights into migratory dynamics. Future integration of migratory models with non-migratory and population dynamics models may provide better understanding and ultimately prediction of monarch butterfly movement and population dynamics at a continental scale.","Department of Natural Resource Ecology and Management, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, United States; Department of Natural Resource Ecology and Management, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, United States; Department of Entomology, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, United States",Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution

However, there are few comprehensive studies on identifying gas channeling channels, the influencing factors, and the corresponding plugging EOR systems in FAORAF. The channeling channels of the injection and production wells of the Changqing Oilfield, China, under varying development schemes are identified utilizing fuzzy membership function theory in this work to obtain their primary distribution. The characteristics and influence factors of gas channeling channels are analyzed by numerical simulation using CMG. The recovery performance of each foam blocking system is evaluated by twin-tube sand pack models. As well, based on the features of reservoir fractures, a new gel-enhanced foam plugging system is developed. The results show that channeling channels chiefly develop along NE 60–70° and that foam could reduce gas channeling. Natural and artificial fractures are the principal factors causing gas channeling, followed by the injection method and gas injection rate. Under the premise of the injection and migration efficiency, the optimal gel system is a 0.1% HPAM + 0.1% organic chromium crosslinking agent. The addition of gel increases the viscosity of the liquid phase and strengthens the mechanical strength of the foam liquid film. At a permeability ratio of 12, the recovery factors of the binary plugging systems composed of microspheres, PEG, and gel combined with foam are 40.89%, 45.85%, and 53.33%, respectively.

The IAPs function as E3 ubiquitin ligases and contribute to pancreatic cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis. Although IAP-targeted therapies have been developed and shown anticancer efficacy in preclinical settings, none of them has been approved yet. Methods Transcriptome data from public datasets were used to analyze the correlation of IAPs and E2s, and the biological function of E2 UbcH5c in pancreatic cancer. A structure-based virtual screen was used to identify UbcH5c inhibitor, and surface plasmon resonance analysis and cellular thermal shift assays were employed to evaluate the binding affinity. The anticancer activities were demonstrated through in vitro and in vivo assays, while the related mechanisms were explored through transcriptomic and proteomic analyses and confirmed by western blot, immunofluorescence, and qRT-PCR. Results UbcH5c is positively correlated with the expression of IAPs in pancreatic cancer. We further found that UbcH5c is overexpressed and associated with a poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer. We identified a small-molecule UbcH5c inhibitor, termed DHPO, which directly bound to UbcH5c protein. DHPO inhibited cell viability and colony formation, induced apoptosis, and suppressed migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. The compound inhibited UbcH5c-mediated IκBα degradation and NF-κB activation, which is critical for its anticancer activity. Furthermore, DHPO suppressed the tumor growth and metastasis in two orthotopic pancreatic tumor mouse models. Conclusions These results indicated that inhibiting UbcH5c is a novel and effective strategy for treating pancreatic cancer and DHPO represents a new class of UbcH5c inhibitor and may be further developed as an anti-pancreatic cancer therapeutic agent.","The Cancer Hospital of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Zhejiang Cancer Hospital), Institute of Basic Medicine and Cancer (IBMC), Chinese Academy of Sciences; The Cancer Hospital of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Zhejiang Cancer Hospital), Institute of Basic Medicine and Cancer (IBMC), Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shanxi Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine; The Cancer Hospital of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Zhejiang Cancer Hospital), Institute of Basic Medicine and Cancer (IBMC), Chinese Academy of Sciences; The Cancer Hospital of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Zhejiang Cancer Hospital), Institute of Basic Medicine and Cancer (IBMC), Chinese Academy of Sciences; The Cancer Hospital of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Zhejiang Cancer Hospital), Institute of Basic Medicine and Cancer (IBMC), Chinese Academy of Sciences; The Cancer Hospital of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Zhejiang Cancer Hospital), Institute of Basic Medicine and Cancer (IBMC), Chinese Academy of Sciences; The Cancer Hospital of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Zhejiang Cancer Hospital), Institute of Basic Medicine and Cancer (IBMC), Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Interdisciplinary Integrative Medicine Research, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; The Cancer Hospital of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Zhejiang Cancer Hospital), Institute of Basic Medicine and Cancer (IBMC), Chinese Academy of Sciences",Molecular Cancer
157,"Deborah S Rogers, Omkar Deshpande, Marcus W Feldman",The spread of inequality.,2011,"The causes of socioeconomic inequality have been debated since the time of Plato. Many reasons for the development of stratification have been proposed, from the need for hierarchical control over large-scale irrigation systems to the accumulation of small differences in wealth over time via inheritance processes. However, none of these explains how unequal societies came to completely displace egalitarian cultural norms over time. Our study models demographic consequences associated with the unequal distribution of resources in stratified societies. Agent-based simulation results show that in constant environments, unequal access to resources can be demographically destabilizing, resulting in the outward migration and spread of such societies even when population size is relatively small. In variable environments, stratified societies spread more and are also better able to survive resource shortages by sequestering mortality in the lower classes. The predictions of our simulation are provided modest support by a range of existing empirical studies. In short, the fact that stratified societies today vastly outnumber egalitarian societies may not be due to the transformation of egalitarian norms and structures, but may instead reflect the more rapid migration of stratified societies and consequent conquest or displacement of egalitarian societies over time.",NaN; NaN; NaN,PLoS ONE

Bellanti, Yun Feng Pan, Song Guo Zheng",Long Non-Coding RNA GAPLINC Promotes Tumor-Like Biologic Behaviors of Fibroblast-Like Synoviocytes as MicroRNA Sponging in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients,2018,"Rapidly accumulating evidence has now suggested that the long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs), a large and diverse class of non-coding transcribed RNA molecules with diverse functional roles and mechanisms, play a major role in the pathogenesis of many human inflammatory diseases. Although some LncRNAs are overexpressed in plasma, T cell, and synovial tissues of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), there is a dearth of knowledge in what role these transcripts play in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) of these patients. Here, our studies showed that GAPLINC, a newly identified functional LncRNA in oncology, displayed a greater degree of expression in FLSs from RA than in patients with traumatic injury. GAPLINC suppression in RA-FLS cells revealed significant alterations in cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and proinflammatory cytokines production. Additionally, we performed a preliminary bioinformatics analysis of GAPLINC gene sequence in order to find its target molecules, using miRanda, PITA, RNAhybrid algorithms, Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes, and gene ontology analysis. Since the results predicted that some of microRNAs and mRNA may interact with GAPLINC, we simulated a gene co-action network model based on a competitive endogenous RNA theory. Further verification of this model demonstrated that silencing of GAPLINC increased miR-382-5p and miR-575 expression. The results of this study suggest that GAPLINC may function as a novel microRNAs sponging agent affecting the biological characteristics of RA-FLSs. Additionally, GAPLINC may also promote RA-FLS tumor-like behaviors in a miR-382-5p-dependent and miR-575-dependent manner. Based upon these findings, LncRNA GAPLINC may provide a novel valuable therapeutic target for RA patients.","Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China; Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China; Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, The Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China; Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China; Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China; Center for Clinic Immunology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China; Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China; Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China; Department of Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Hershey Medical Center at Penn State University, Hershey, PA, United States; Department of Pediatrics and Microbiology-Immunology, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC, United States; Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China; Department of Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Hershey Medical Center at Penn State University, Hershey, PA, United States",Frontiers in Immunology

Zulkarnain, Zurina Mohd Hanapi, Shamala Subramaniam",A Spawn Mobile Agent Itinerary Planning Approach for Energy-Efficient Data Gathering in Wireless Sensor Networks,2017,"Mobile agent (MA), a part of the mobile computing paradigm, was recently proposed for data gathering in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The MA-based approach employs two algorithms: Single-agent Itinerary Planning (SIP) and Multi-mobile agent Itinerary Planning (MIP) for energy-efficient data gathering. The MIP was proposed to outperform the weakness of SIP by introducing distributed multi MAs to perform the data gathering task. Despite the advantages of MIP, finding the optimal number of distributed MAs and their itineraries are still regarded as critical issues. The existing MIP algorithms assume that the itinerary of the MA has to start and return back to the sink node. Moreover, each distributed MA has to carry the processing code (data aggregation code) to collect the sensory data and return back to the sink with the accumulated data. However, these assumptions have resulted in an increase in the number of MA’s migration hops, which subsequently leads to an increase in energy and time consumption. In this paper, a spawn multi-mobile agent itinerary planning (SMIP) approach is proposed to mitigate the substantial increase in cost of energy and time used in the data gathering processes. The proposed approach is based on the agent spawning such that the main MA is able to spawn other MAs with different tasks assigned from the main MA. Extensive simulation experiments have been conducted to test the performance of the proposed approach against some selected MIP algorithms. The results show that the proposed SMIP outperforms the counterpart algorithms in terms of energy consumption and task delay (time), and improves the integrated energy-delay performance.","Department of Wireless and Communication Technology, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technolog, University Putra Malaysia, Serdang 43400, Malaysia; Department of Wireless and Communication Technology, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technolog, University Putra Malaysia, Serdang 43400, Malaysia; Department of Wireless and Communication Technology, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technolog, University Putra Malaysia, Serdang 43400, Malaysia; Department of Wireless and Communication Technology, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technolog, University Putra Malaysia, Serdang 43400, Malaysia",Sensors

Studies have shown that caffeine reduces the cytotoxic effects of paclitaxel and inhibits paclitaxel-induced apoptosis; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether caffeine inhibits the antitumor activity of paclitaxel via down-regulation of α-tubulin acetylation. In vitro studies, involving MTT assay, wound-healing assay, cell apoptosis assay, and western blotting analysis of A549 and HeLa cells, were performed. A549 and HeLa cell-based xenografts were established, and western blotting and immunohistochemical staining were performed for in vivo studies. The results showed that caffeine promoted the growth of cancer cells treated with paclitaxel. Additionally, caffeine enhanced migration ability, inhibited apoptosis, and decreased the acetylation of α-tubulin in paclitaxel-treated cancer cells. Furthermore, caffeine decreased the inhibitory effect of paclitaxel on tumor growth through down-regulation of α-tubulin acetylation in vivo. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that caffeine inhibits the anticancer activity of paclitaxel via down-regulation of α-tubulin acetylation, suggesting that patients receiving treatment with taxanes, such as paclitaxel, should avoid consuming caffeinated beverages or foods.","Key Laboratory of Pu-er Tea Science, Ministry of Education, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, 650201, China; College of Science, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, 650201, China; Key Laboratory of Pu-er Tea Science, Ministry of Education, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, 650201, China; College of Food Science and Technology, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, 650201, China; Key Laboratory of Pu-er Tea Science, Ministry of Education, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, 650201, China; College of Food Science and Technology, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, 650201, China; Key Laboratory of Pu-er Tea Science, Ministry of Education, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, 650201, China; College of Food Science and Technology, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, 650201, China; Key Laboratory of Pu-er Tea Science, Ministry of Education, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, 650201, China; College of Food Science and Technology, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, 650201, China; Key Laboratory of Pu-er Tea Science, Ministry of Education, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, 650201, China; College of Science, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, 650201, China; Key Laboratory of Pu-er Tea Science, Ministry of Education, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, 650201, China; College of Food Science and Technology, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, 650201, China; Corresponding authors at: Yunnan Agricultural University, Heilongtan, North of Kunming, Kunming, 650201, China.; Key Laboratory of Pu-er Tea Science, Ministry of Education, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, 650201, China; College of Science, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, 650201, China; State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Kunming, 650201, China; Corresponding authors at: Yunnan Agricultural University, Heilongtan, North of Kunming, Kunming, 650201, China.; Key Laboratory of Pu-er Tea Science, Ministry of Education, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, 650201, China; State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Kunming, 650201, China; Corresponding authors at: Yunnan Agricultural University, Heilongtan, North of Kunming, Kunming, 650201, China.",Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy

Myofibroblasts can deposit excess amounts of extracellular matrix. Cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor exhibits strong anti-inflammatory response; however, this is usually achieved with undesirable side effects. In this study, we demonstrated the effects of the fluorine-modified rutaecarpine (RUT), fluoro-2-methoxyrutaecarpine (F-RUT), in inflammatory damage in the lungs. Based on the results, F-RUT retained anti-inflammatory activity both in vitro and in vivo in lungs. Compared to the parent compound, F-RUT showed better COX-2 suppression as a COX-2-selective inhibitor with lower cytotoxicity, and enhanced molecular reactivity and biological activity. F-RUT was also observed to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and inflammatory infiltrating neutrophils in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated zebrafish and ovalbumin (OVA)/alum-challenged KLF-10-knockout mouse lungs, respectively. Furthermore, F-RUT ameliorated the respiratory function in OVA/alum-challenged BALB/c mice by maintaining the thickness of the blood-air barrier in mouse lungs. Overall, these data suggest that F-RUT may function as an effective therapeutic agent for inflammation-induced lung dysfunction, and a better selection for pharmaceutical purposes than conventionally used anti-inflammatory agents.","Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Biological Chemistry, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Food Technology and Marketing Management, Taipei University of Marine Technology, Taipei, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Biochemical and Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan",Frontiers in Pharmacology

Low molecular weight plasticizers, such as tributyl 2-acetyl citrate (TAC), cannot properly solve this issue. Herein, PHB films were obtained using a biosynthesized poly(3-hydroxyoctanoate) (PHO) and a commercially available TAC as toughening agents. The use of TAC strongly decreased the PHB thermal stability up to 200 °C due to the loss of low boiling point plasticizer, while minor weight loss was noticed at this temperature for the PHB-PHO blend. Both agents shifted the glass transition temperature of PHB to a lower temperature, the effect being more pronounced for TAC. The elongation at break of PHB increased by 700% after PHO addition and by only 185% in the case of TAC; this demonstrates an important toughening effect of the polymeric modifier. Migration of TAC to the upper surface of the films and no sign of migration in the case of PHO were highlighted by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) results. In vitro biocompatibility tests showed that all the PHB films are non-toxic towards L929 cells and have no proinflammatory immune response. The use of PHO as a toughening agent in PHB represents an attractive solution to its brittleness in the case of packaging and biomedical applications while conserving its biodegradability and biocompatibility.","Polymer Department, National Institute for R&D in Chemistry and Petrochemistry ICECHIM, 202 Splaiul Independentei, 060021 Bucharest, Romania; Polymer Department, National Institute for R&D in Chemistry and Petrochemistry ICECHIM, 202 Splaiul Independentei, 060021 Bucharest, Romania; National Institute for Chemical Pharmaceutical Research and Development ICCF, 112 Calea Vitan, 031299 Bucharest, Romania; Cantacuzino National Institute of R&D for Microbiology and Immunology, 103 Splaiul Independentei, 050096 Bucharest, Romania; Polymer Department, National Institute for R&D in Chemistry and Petrochemistry ICECHIM, 202 Splaiul Independentei, 060021 Bucharest, Romania; Polymer Department, National Institute for R&D in Chemistry and Petrochemistry ICECHIM, 202 Splaiul Independentei, 060021 Bucharest, Romania; Polymer Department, National Institute for R&D in Chemistry and Petrochemistry ICECHIM, 202 Splaiul Independentei, 060021 Bucharest, Romania; Advanced Polymer Materials Group, Faculty of Applied Chemistry and Materials Science, University Politehnica of Bucharest, 1-7 Gheorghe Polizu, 011061 Bucharest, Romania; Polymer Department, National Institute for R&D in Chemistry and Petrochemistry ICECHIM, 202 Splaiul Independentei, 060021 Bucharest, Romania",Polymers

Defining the home location of each person as the place of most frequent calls, it is found that approximately 60% of people who spend nights away from home have regular destinations that are repeatedly visited, although only 10% have 3 or more regular destinations. The number of journeys involving overnight stays peaks at a distance of 50 km, although roughly half of such journeys exceed 100 km. Most visits only involve a stay of one or two nights away from home, with just 4% exceeding one week. A new agent-based migration model is introduced, based on a gravity model adapted to represent overnight journeys. Each agent makes journeys involving overnight stays to either regular or random locations, with journey and destination probabilities taken from the mobile phone dataset. Preliminary simulations show that the agentbased model can approximately reproduce the patterns of migration involving overnight stays.","Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics, Trieste; London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London",Geospatial Health

In the poverty alleviation practices in China, ecological poverty alleviation (EPA) is regarded as an important way to synthesize the dual goals of poverty reduction and environmental protection and to achieve the win-win outcomes. Many Chinese researchers have fruitful research achievements on EPA yet they do not recognize that EPA is not a simple combination of various policies, but a complex system involving multiple policy instruments, governmental agencies, social forces, and agents. However, few studies abroad illustrate EPA in detail. They focus more on specific components of EPA such as payment for ecosystem services while overlooking the integral concept of EPA and practices from China. Based on field research in Guizhou Province, China, this paper proposes a framework of EPA with an effective multi-agent and co-government system, for demonstrating the concept and practice of EPA. With case analysis, we illustrate key elements in this system and their relationships, and how they play a vital role in pursuing win-win outcomes in environmental protection and poverty alleviation. The three dimensions of this EPA system have been discussed. The first is to strengthen the interaction among the agents. Many efforts should be made for establishing an efficient communication routine and a stable relationship among their interests. The second is to reinforce the connection between diverse elements in each policy subsystem, such as the systematization and coordination of the ecological industry development, the systematization of the links before, during, and after the relocation of ecological immigrants, etc. The third is to promote the interactions between the three subsystems, so that ecological enhancement, ecological compensation, and industrial development, and migration and relocation can promote each other, and ultimately promote the coordination of poverty alleviation and ecological protection in poverty-stricken areas. Thus, this paper analyzes how to establish the communication routine among the relevant agents of EPA, the interaction among the internal elements of the subsystems, and the relationship between the subsystems in series, trying to reveal the basic operating mechanism of the system.","Institute on Poverty Research, Peking University, Beijing 100871, P.R.

The late stage detection, the peritoneal dissemination and the acquisition of resistance against carboplatin are the main reasons to explain this poor prognosis and strengthen the need of alternative treatments to improve the management of ovarian cancer and/or to sensitize tumors to platinum salts. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), hepatocyte growth factor receptor (Met) and cellular Src kinase (c-Src) are crucial kinases implied in ovarian tumor growth, survival, invasion and resistance to carboplatin. Their expression is increased in advanced ovarian cancers and is correlated with poor prognosis. Despite a clear potential in inhibiting these proteins in ovarian cancer, as a single agent or in combination with a carboplatin treatment, we need to target kinases in tandem because of their capacity to trigger compensatory pathways that synergize to promote drug resistance. Methods Here we target EGFR, c-Src and Met individually or in combination with carboplatin, using Gefitinib, Dasatinib and Crizotinib respectively, in a panel of carboplatin-sensitive (OVCAR-3, IGROV-1 and A2780) and carboplatin-resistant cells (SKOV-3 and EFO-21). We studied the ability of the most potent combination to induce apoptosis, regulate migration, invasion and to modulate the activation of proliferation and survival proteins. Results Crizotinib, Dasatinib and Gefitinib, alone or in combination with carboplatin, showed a cell-specific cytotoxic synergy in ovarian cancer cells. The Dasatinib plus Gefitinib combination was synergistic in OVCAR-3, SKOV-3 and, in IGROV-1 cells (high concentrations). This combination was unable to induce apoptosis but suppressed cell migration, invasion and the activation of EGFR, Erk, c-Src and Akt compared to single treatments. Conclusions Combining carboplatin with kinase inhibitors lead to synergistic interactions in a cell-specific manner. Unlike platinum-based combinations, mixing Dasatinib with Gefitinib led to cytotoxic activity, inhibition of cell migration and invasion. Thus, the Dasatinib + Gefitinib combination presents anti-tumour properties that are superior to those of platinum-based combinations, indicating that it may well represent a promising new treatment modality to be tested in the clinic.",Research Institute – McGill University Health Center (MUHC); Research Institute – McGill University Health Center (MUHC),Journal of Ovarian Research

170,"Masud M A, Jae-Young Kim, Cheol-Ho Pan, Eunjung Kim",The impact of the spatial heterogeneity of resistant cells and fibroblasts on treatment response,2022,"A long-standing practice in the treatment of cancer is that of hitting hard with the maximum tolerated dose to eradicate tumors. This continuous therapy, however, selects for resistant cells, leading to the failure of the treatment. A different type of treatment strategy, adaptive therapy, has recently been shown to have a degree of success in both preclinical xenograft experiments and clinical trials. Adaptive therapy is used to maintain a tumor’s volume by exploiting the competition between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cells with minimum effective drug doses or timed drug holidays. To further understand the role of competition in the outcomes of adaptive therapy, we developed a 2D on-lattice agent-based model. Our simulations show that the superiority of the adaptive strategy over continuous therapy depends on the local competition shaped by the spatial distribution of resistant cells. Intratumor competition can also be affected by fibroblasts, which produce microenvironmental factors that promote cancer cell growth. To this end, we simulated the impact of different fibroblast distributions on treatment outcomes. As a proof of principle, we focused on five types of distribution of fibroblasts characterized by different locations, shapes, and orientations of the fibroblast region with respect to the resistant cells. Our simulation shows that the spatial architecture of fibroblasts modulates tumor progression in both continuous and adaptive therapy. Finally, as a proof of concept, we simulated the outcomes of adaptive therapy of a virtual patient with four metastatic sites composed of different spatial distributions of fibroblasts and drug-resistant cell populations. Our simulation highlights the importance of undetected metastatic lesions on adaptive therapy outcomes. Author summary Tumors are composed of different cancer cells with varying degrees of treatment resistance, which compete for a shared resource. Adaptive therapy exploits this competition. The paradigm employs patient-specific on and off treatment schedules or lower doses to permit a significant number of drug-sensitive cells to survive. The surviving sensitive cells can suppress the growth of drug-resistant cells via intratumor competition. This competition can be modulated by the spatial structure of tumors. For example, resistant cell configuration, carrying capacity, or migration rate may change local spatial competition between drug-resistant cells or between drug-sensitive and drug resistant cells. In addition, the presence of growth factors produced by stromal cells such as fibroblasts promotes the proliferation of cells, enhancing the competition. To understand the impact of forenamed factors on the outcomes of adaptive therapy, we developed a computational model, 2D on-lattice agent-based model. Our findings show that the spatial factors regulate the local competition and may hold back the benefit of adaptive therapy. Further, the impact of fibroblast depends on the respective positioning of fibroblast to the resistant cells. Finally, we simulated the outcomes of adaptive therapy on multiple metastatic lesions of mixed spatial configuration on a virtual patient. In the simulation, we highlight the importance of undetected metastatic lesions on therapy outcomes.",NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN,PLoS Computational Biology

Thorough review was completed and data relevant to methods of diagnosis, treatment, complications, hospital readmission, and mortality were extracted from patient charts. The patients were followed for two years after diagnosis.Results: Of the 47 patients identified as having “MTS”, 32 (70%) were diagnosed formally with either magnetic resonance venography, computed tomography venography, or ultrasound. Two patients were excluded for insufficient availability of follow-up records. Mean age of the population included (N = 30) was 50.24 ± 15.33 years and 83% (N = 25) had female gender. The majority (40%) of patients were treated with anticoagulation, thrombolysis, and stent placement, and 13.3% received a combination of anticoagulation, antiplatelet agent, thrombolysis, and stent placement. Overall, we found 28 patients (93%) who underwent endovascular stenting. However, 39.3% (11/28) had stent-related complications that included stent thrombosis, stenosis, and migration. One patient underwent open heart surgery for stent retrieval. Duration of anticoagulation therapy ranged from 6 months to lifelong. Two patients (6.7%) suffered major bleeds requiring transfusion. Fourteen patients (46.6%) developed post-thrombotic syndrome. Seven (23.3%) patients required MTS-related readmission within 30 days. No mortality was noted at two-year follow-up.Conclusion: Although our study only included 30 patients, it was evident to us that there is no consensus in the management of MTS. Furthermore, endovascular stenting, which has a major role in the management of MTS, has complication rates that hover close to 40%. Further research is needed to help develop a standardized evidence-based approach in the management of MTS that ensures a decreased risk of immediate and long-term complications.Keywords: May–Thurner syndrome, treatment, complications, diagnosis, anticoagulation",NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN,International Journal of General Medicine

However, its expression and function in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain unclear. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore the effects of miR-32 expression on NSCLC tumorigenesis and development. Methods: Using real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), we detected miR-32 expression in NSCLC cell lines and primary tumor tissues. The association of miR-32 expression with clinicopathological factors and prognosis was also analyzed. Then, the effects of miR-32 expression on the biological behavior of NSCLC cells were investigated. Finally, the potential regulatory effect of miR-32 on SOX9 expression was confirmed.Results: miR-32 expression levels were significantly downregulated in NSCLC compared with the corresponding noncancerous lung tissues (P&lt;0.001). In addition, decreased miR-32 expression was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (P=0.002), advanced tumor/nodes/metastasis (TNM) classification stages (P&lt;0.001), and shorter overall survival (P&lt;0.001). Multivariate regression analysis corroborated that downregulated miR-32 expression was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for NSCLC patients. In vitro studies demonstrated that miR-32 overexpression reduced A549 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and promoted apoptosis. Furthermore, SOX9 was confirmed as a direct target of miR-32, using a luciferase reporter assay.Conclusion: These findings indicate that miR-32 may act as a tumor suppressor in NSCLC and could serve as a novel therapeutic agent for miR-based therapy.

However, their performance still suffers from severe ion migration, trap‐induced nonradiative recombination, and black phase instability due to lower tolerance factor and high total energy. Here, a combinational passivation strategy to suppress ion migration and reduce traps both on the surface and in the bulk of the CsPhTh3 perovskite film is developed, resulting in improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) to as high as 19.37%. The involvement of guanidinium (GA) into the CsPhTh3 perovskite bulk film and glycocyamine (GCA) passivation on the perovskite surface and grain boundary synergistically enlarge the tolerance factor and suppress the trap state density. In addition, the acetate anion as a nucleating agent significantly improves the thermodynamic stability of GA‐doped CsPbTh3 film through the slight distortion of PbI6 octahedra. The decreased nonradiative recombination loss translates to a high fill factor of 82.1% and open‐circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.17 V. Furthermore, bare CsPbTh3 perovskite solar cells without any encapsulation retain 80% of its initial PCE value after being stored for one month under ambient conditions.",Key Laboratory of Powder Material & Advanced Ceramics International Scientific & Technological Cooperation Base of Industrial Waste Recycling and Advanced Materials Ningxia Research Center of Silicon Target and Silicon–Carbon Negative Materials Engineering Technology School of Materials Science & Engineering North Minzu University Yinchuan 750021 P.

However, increasing resistance to insecticides threatens to undermine these efforts. Understanding the evolution and propagation of resistance is thus imperative to mitigating loss of intervention effectiveness. Additionally, accelerated research and development of new tools that can be deployed alongside existing vector control strategies is key to eradicating malaria in the near future. Methods such as gene drives that aim to genetically modify large mosquito populations in the wild to either render them refractory to malaria or impair their reproduction may prove invaluable tools. Mathematical models of gene flow in populations, which is the transfer of genetic information from one population to another through migration, can offer invaluable insight into the behavior and potential impact of gene drives as well as the spread of insecticide resistance in the wild. Here, we present the first multi-locus, agent-based model of vector genetics that accounts for mutations and a many-to-many mapping cardinality of genotypes to phenotypes to investigate gene flow, and the propagation of gene drives in Anopheline populations. This model is embedded within a large scale individual-based model of malaria transmission representative of a high burden, high transmission setting characteristic of the Sahel. Results are presented for the selection of insecticide-resistant vectors and the spread of resistance through repeated deployment of insecticide treated nets (ITNs), in addition to scenarios where gene drives act in concert with existing vector control tools such as ITNs. The roles of seasonality, spatial distribution of vector habitat and feed sites, and existing vector control in propagating alleles that confer phenotypic traits via gene drives that result in reduced transmission are explored. The ability to model a spectrum of vector species with different genotypes and phenotypes in the context of malaria transmission allows us to test deployment strategies for existing interventions that reduce the deleterious effects of resistance and allows exploration of the impact of new tools being proposed or developed.",NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN,PLoS Computational Biology

It was long speculated whether these virulence factors could serve as therapeutics in diseases in which abnormal immune activation plays a role. We adopted the secreted chemotaxis inhibitory protein of Staphylococcus aureus (CHIPS) as a model virulence factor-based therapeutic agent for diseases in which C5AR1 stimulation plays an important role. We show that the administration of CHIPS in human C5AR1 knock-in mice successfully dampens C5a-mediated neutrophil migration during immune complex-initiated inflammation. Subsequent CHIPS toxicology studies in animal models were promising. However, during a small phase I trial, healthy human volunteers showed adverse effects directly after CHIPS administration. Subjects showed clinical signs of anaphylaxis with mild leukocytopenia and increased C-reactive protein concentrations, which are possibly related to the presence of relatively high circulating anti-CHIPS antibodies and suggest an inflammatory response. Even though our data in mice show CHIPS as a potential anti-inflammatory agent, safety issues in human subjects temper the use of CHIPS in its current form as a therapeutic candidate. The use of staphylococcal proteins, or other bacterial proteins, as therapeutics or immune-modulators in humans is severely hampered by pre-existing circulating antibodies.","

However, the anti-metastatic effect and molecular mechanism(s) of baicalein on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain poorly understood. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the anti-metastatic effects of baicalein and related mechanism(s) on HCC. Based on assays utilized in both HCC cell lines and in an animal model, we found that baicalein inhibited tumor cell metastasis in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, after treatment with baicalein for 24 hours, there was a decrease in the levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9 and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) expression as well as proteinase activity in hepatocellular carcinoma MHCC97H cells. Meanwhile, the expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and TIMP-2 were increased in a dose-dependent fashion. Moreover, baicalein treatment dramatically decreased the levels of the phosphorylated forms of MEK1 and ERK1/2. MEK1 overexpression partially blocked the anti-metastatic effects of baicalein. Combined treatment with an ERK inhibitor (U0126) and baicalein resulted in a synergistic reduction in MMP-2, MMP-9 and u-PA expression and an increase in TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 expression; the invasive capabilities of MHCC97H cells were also inhibited.

181,"abbas hatami, susan norbakhsh",Semantic Reconstruction of the Water Crisis in the East of Isfahan Based on Grounded Theory,2019,"<strong>Introduction</strong> <br />In recent years, the data and objective conditions indicate Iran's entry into a new era of environmental crises, especially in the water. According to United Nations indicators, Iran currently has a severe water crisis, because about 69% of the total annual renewable water used in the country .Also, according to statement political officials, if the water crisis Continuity, about 50 million people will be forced to migrate in Iran in the next 25 years, and the east and south of the country will be actually empty. Meanwhile, the eastern part of Isfahan is one of the areas that, despite the seriousness of the water crisis in it, has been less an issue of independent research. This research gap is that firstly, dehydration has led to unrest in the region at least in two periods, 2012 and 2017 respectively. Secondly, the three cities studied in this research, namely, Ziar, Ezhieh and Varzaneh are very important cities in the east of Isfahan. Thirdly, these three cities are Zayande rood legal and historic lords due to their occupation. Accordingly, the research seeks to understand the meaning of Ziar, Ezhieh and Varzaneh farmers on the water crisis with the Emic approach and using the method of Anselm Strauss and Juliet Corbin's theoretical approach, namely Grounded Theory. The questions of this research are:  What causes or causes of water crisis from the perspective of the farmers of Ziar, Eziyeh and Varzaneh? What are the strategies of these farmers in confronting the water crisis? Finally, what are the consequences of the water crisis for farmers Ziar, Eziyeh and Varzaneh? <br />  <br />Material & Methods <br />In this research, qualitative research method has been used. In this study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 farmers from Ziar, Ezhieh and Varzaneh in eastern Isfahan in order to understand the participants' mental world. Sampling was done using purposeful sampling method and theoretical sampling was used to collect data. The sample size and data computation method are of theoretical saturation type. In our study, after 7 interviews, theoretical saturation was achieved, but to ensure more interviews were continued to 17 cases. In this research, simultaneously with the interviews, data coding began and then analyzed using the grounded theory. The data encryption consists of three steps: open coding, central coding, and selective coding. The method of validating the grounded theory is through ""accreditation by members"", ""analytical comparison"" and ""audit technique"". <br />In the present study, in the ""open coding"" stage, 35 initial concepts were extracted, then by central coding we transform them into abstract concepts in the form of 16 main categories. In the ""selective coding"" stage, according to the categories obtained, a ""core category"" was extracted which is considered to be the core of the research. This categories include: Unstable Development, Semi-Finished Project, Lack of National Approach, Lack of Law, The Weakness Political Authority, Economic Monopolies, Changing Climatic Conditions, Urban Migration, Political and Social Frustration, Negotiating with the Government, Rebellion, Increase in Poverty, Increasing Unproductive Businesses, Alternative Economic Strategies, Increasing the cleavage of Nation-State and Security Challenges. <br />In this study, ""bad governance of water"" as a core category of the contextual data was extracted. According to this category, the farmers of Ziar, Ezhieh and Varzaneh understand and interpret the changes that have been made in their lives, or water crisis as a phenomenon associated with the mismanagement of water. Issues such as unsustainable development, semi-integrated water development projects, lack of nationalism and lack of law, and the weakness of political authority all fall under water mismanagement or bad governance of water. Theoretically one of the finest analyzes in the field of economic governance of natural resources, including water, is the discussion of the political economist Elinor Ostrom. She showed how natural resources can be well managed from the groups they use and not the state. This view points out that local institutions are more effective elements in managing common natural resources. From this theoretical view, the study of Zayande rood water basin also shows that during the centuries, local exploiters of Zayande Rood River have been able to manage the sustainable management of this source based on the Sheikh Bahaei Scroll. However, the basin was gradually subjected to a state-owned regime, and thus, in addition to violate of the historic and legal rights, part of the Zayanderud was owned by the state. In this process, the Sheikh Bahaei Scroll, which was once the basis of the actions of the farmers and the sovereignty, was gradually abandoned and has become the place of conflict between the farmer and the state. <br />Finally we try to provide paradigm research model. Based on the research findings, the water crisis in eastern Isfahan is classified into three categories: causal, contextual and effective. Casual Conditions include Unstable Development, Contextual Conditions include lack of law, the weakness of political authority and changing climatic of conditions, Effective Conditions include Semi-Finished Project and Lack of National Approach.  Also in this research the Process and Interactional are Urban Migration, Alternative Economic Strategies, Negotiating with the Government, Political and Social Frustration and Rebellion. And finally, Consequential include Increase in Poverty, Increasing Unproductive Businesses, Economic Monopolies, Widening the Cleavage of Nation-State and Security Challenges. <br />  <br />Discussion of Results & Conclusions <br />In this research, based on the paradigm model, the bad water Governance as the core category and the final answer to the research questions have been extracted. According to this category, the farmers of Ziar, Ezhieh and Varzaneh understand the water crisis as a phenomenon that is directly linked to the mismanagement of water by the government. In fact, the government has been seen as the main culprit for the water crisis by society, which has been the exclusive agent for water governance. This teaches us that collective action in material and economic life requires attention to the various institutional arrangements governing these actions. In the form of these actions, the state must have a fundamental understanding that it is only one of the institutions associated with material life and not only an exclusive entity in this field. But the government in Iran has shown that it has not done so in the Zayande rood  Basin, and that is why it is known by the social structure to blame for the water crisis. Therefore, due to such an understanding in social structure, it is necessary for the government to provide a contextual platform for the perceptual gap to be adjusted. If this gap is wider and more active than before, it can further expand the cleavage between the government and the nation in Iran.","political science, Economic Factualty, university of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran; political science, Economic Factualty, university of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran",جامعه شناسی کاربردی

The coordination between leader cell and follower cell affects the rate of collective cell migration. However, there are still very few papers on the impacts of the stimulus signal released by the leader on the follower. Tracking cell movement using 3D time-lapse microscopy images provides an unprecedented opportunity to systematically study and analyze collective cell migration. Results Recently, deep reinforcement learning algorithms have become very popular. In our paper, we also use this method to train the number of cells and control signals. By experimenting with single-follower cell and multi-follower cells, it is concluded that the number of stimulation signals is proportional to the rate of collective movement of the cells. Such research provides a more diverse approach and approach to studying biological problems. Conclusion Traditional research methods are always based on real-life scenarios, but as the number of cells grows exponentially, the research process is too time consuming. Agent-based modeling is a robust framework that approximates cells to isotropic, elastic, and sticky objects. In this paper, an agent-based modeling framework is used to establish a simulation platform for simulating collective cell migration.

However, CSC efficiency is low, likely due to limited cell survival and engraftment after transplantation. The Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, Y-27632, significantly increased cell survival rate, adhesion, and migration in numerous types of cells, including stem cells, suggesting a common feature of the ROCK-mediated apoptotic pathway that may also exist in human CSCs. In this study, we examine the hypothesis that pretreatment of human CSCs with Y-27632 protects cells from Doxorubicin (Dox) induced apoptosis.c-kit+ CSCs were cultured in CSC medium for 3-5 days followed by 48 hr treatment with 0 to 10 μM Y-27632 alone, 0 to 1.0 μM Dox alone, or Y-27632 followed by Dox (48 hrs). Cell viability, toxicity, proliferation, morphology, migration, Caspase-3 activity, expression levels of apoptotic-related key proteins and c-kit+ were examined. Results showed that 48 hr treatment with Y-27632 alone did not result in great changes in c-kit+ expression, proliferation, Caspase-3 activity, or apoptosis; however cell viability was significantly increased and cell migration was promoted. These effects likely involve the ROCK/Actin pathways. In contrast, 48 hr treatment with Dox alone dramatically increased Caspase-3 activity, resulting in cell death. Although Y-27632 alone did not affect the expression levels of apoptotic-related key factors (p-Akt, Akt, Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, Bax, cleaved Caspase-3, and Caspase-3) under basal conditions, it significantly inhibited the Dox-induced increase in cleaved Caspase-3 and reduced cell death under Dox treatment.We conclude that preconditioning human CSCs with Y-27632 significantly reduces Dox-induced cell death and possibly involves the cleaved Caspase-3 and ROCK/Actin pathways. The beneficial effects of Y-27632 may be applied to stem cell-based therapy to increase cell survival rates after transplantation or to act as a cardiac protective agent for Dox-treated cancer patients.",NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN,PLoS ONE

The active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of Transferon is based on polydispersion of peptides that have been extracted from lysed human leukocytes by a dialysis process and a subsequent ultrafiltration step to select molecules below 10 kDa. To physicochemically characterize the drug product, we developed chromatographic methods and an SDS-PAGE approach to analyze the composition and the overall variability of Transferon. Reversed-phase chromatographic profiles of peptide populations demonstrated batch-to-batch consistency from 10 representative batches that harbored 4 primary peaks with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of less than 7%. Aminogram profiles exhibited 17 proteinogenic amino acids and showed that glycine was the most abundant amino acid, with a relative content of approximately 18%. Further, based on their electrophoretic migration, the peptide populations exhibited a molecular mass of about 10 kDa. Finally, we determined the Transferon fingerprint using a mass spectrometry tool. Because each batch was produced from independent pooled buffy coat samples from healthy donors, supplied by a local blood bank, our results support the consistency of the production of Transferon and reveal its peptide identity with regard to its physicochemical attributes.","Unidad de Desarrollo e Investigación en Bioprocesos (UDIBI), Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biológicas, Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Prolongación de Carpio y Plan de Ayala s/n, Colonia Santo Tomás, 11340 Ciudad de México, Mexico; Unidad de Desarrollo e Investigación en Bioprocesos (UDIBI), Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biológicas, Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Prolongación de Carpio y Plan de Ayala s/n, Colonia Santo Tomás, 11340 Ciudad de México, Mexico; Unidad de Desarrollo e Investigación en Bioprocesos (UDIBI), Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biológicas, Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Prolongación de Carpio y Plan de Ayala s/n, Colonia Santo Tomás, 11340 Ciudad de México, Mexico; Unidad de Desarrollo e Investigación en Bioprocesos (UDIBI), Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biológicas, Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Prolongación de Carpio y Plan de Ayala s/n, Colonia Santo Tomás, 11340 Ciudad de México, Mexico; Departamento de Farmacología, Cinvestav-IPN, Avenida Instituto Politécnico Nacional 2508, Colonia San Pedro Zacatenco, 07360 Ciudad de México, Mexico; Departamento de Farmacología, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Ciudad Universitaria, 04510 Ciudad de México, Mexico; Departamento de Inmunología, Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biológicas, Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Prolongación de Carpio y Plan de Ayala s/n, Colonia Santo Tomás, 11340 Ciudad de México, Mexico; Laboratorio de Psicoinmunología, Dirección de Investigaciones en Neurociencias, Instituto Nacional de Psiquiatría Ramón de la Fuente, Calzada México-Xochimilco 101, Colonia San Lorenzo Huipulco, 14370 Ciudad de México, Mexico; Unidad de Desarrollo e Investigación en Bioprocesos (UDIBI), Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biológicas, Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Prolongación de Carpio y Plan de Ayala s/n, Colonia Santo Tomás, 11340 Ciudad de México, Mexico",BioMed Research International

Treating cancers requires substantial resources, including skilled personnel, medications, instruments, and funds. Thus, developing cancer prevention and treatment measures is necessary for healthcare personnel and patients alike. P. odoratum (Polygonaceae family) is a plant used as a culinary ingredient. It exhibits several pharmacological activities, such as antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer. Several classes of phytochemical constituents of P. odoratum have been reported. The important ones might be polyphenol and flavonoid derivatives. In this systematic review, the activities of P. odoratum against cancerous cells were determined and summarized. Data were obtained through a systematic search of electronic databases (EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus, Thai Thesis Database, Science Direct and Clinical Key). Eight studies met the eligibility criteria. The cancerous cell lines used in the studies were lymphoma, leukemia, oral, lung, breast, colon, and liver cancer cells. Based on this review, P. odoratum extracts significantly affected Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome-carrying human lymphoblastoid (Raji), mouse lymphocytic leukemia (P388), human acute lymphocytic leukemia (Jurkat), breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), human colon adenocarcinoma (HT-29), human T lymphoblast (MOLT-4), human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL-60), human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), and oral squamous cell carcinoma (SAS, SCC-9, HSC-3) through induction of cell apoptosis, arrest of the cell cycle, inhibition of cell proliferation, migration, and colonization. The molecular mechanism of P. odoratum against cancers was reported to involve suppressing essential proteins required for cell proliferation, colonization, migration, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. They were survivin, cyclin-D, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). The extract of P. odoratum was also involved in the protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway by inhibiting the expression of Akt, phosphorylated Akt, mTOR, and phosphorylated mTOR. From the key results of this review, P. odoratum is a promising chemotherapy and chemopreventive agent. Further investigation of its pharmacological activity and mechanism of action should be conducted using standardized extracts. In vivo experiments and clinical trials are required to confirm the anticancer activity.","Chiwamitra Cancer Hospital, Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand; Unit of Excellence on Clinical Outcomes Research and Integration (UNICORN), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Phayao, Phayao, Thailand; Division of Pharmacy and Technology, Department of Pharmaceutical Care, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Phayao, Phayao, Thailand; Unit of Excellence on Clinical Outcomes Research and Integration (UNICORN), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Phayao, Phayao, Thailand; Center of Health Outcomes Research and Therapeutic Safety (Cohorts), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Phayao, Phayao, Thailand; Department of Physiology, School of Medical Sciences, University of Phayao, Phayao, Thailand; Unit of Excellence on Clinical Outcomes Research and Integration (UNICORN), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Phayao, Phayao, Thailand; Center of Health Outcomes Research and Therapeutic Safety (Cohorts), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Phayao, Phayao, Thailand; Division of Pharmacy Practice, Department of Pharmaceutical Care, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Phayao, Phayao, Thailand; Chiwamitra Cancer Hospital, Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand; Chiwamitra Cancer Hospital, Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand; Chiwamitra Cancer Hospital, Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand; Chiwamitra Cancer Hospital, Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand; Chiwamitra Cancer Hospital, Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand; Chiwamitra Cancer Hospital, Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand; Chiwamitra Cancer Hospital, Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand; Chiwamitra Cancer Hospital, Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand; Division of Ambulatory Medicine, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkoknoi, Thailand",Frontiers in Pharmacology

Mounting evidence has demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in chemoresistance and tumorigenesis. However, the roles of microRNA-501-5p (miR-501) in doxorubicin resistance and gastric cancer cell proliferation and invasion are still not fully understood. In this study, we identified that BLID (BH3-like motif-containing protein, cell death inducer) was directly regulated by miR-501 at the post-transcriptional level in multiple gastric cancer cell lines. Endogenous miR-501 was higher, whereas BLID was lower, in doxorubicin-resistant gastric cancer SGC7901/ADR cells compared with their parental SGC7901 cells. miR-501 suppressed gastric cancer cell apoptosis, induced resistance to doxorubicin, and enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Subcutaneous injection of miR-501 lentivirus-infected SGC7901 cells resulted in rapid growth of xenograft tumors and resistance to doxorubicin treatment, unlike injection of negative miRNA lentivirus-infected SGC7901 cells. This is achieved at least partially by directly targeting BLID and subsequent inactivation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and phosphorylation of Akt. Taken together, miR-501 induces doxorubicin resistance and enhances the tumorigenesis of gastric cancer cells by suppressing BLID. miR-501 might be a potential target for doxorubicin resistance and gastric cancer therapy.

However, the therapeutic effect of osthole on arthritis has not been explored. In the present study, a collagen-induced arthritis rat model, IL-1β-stimulated SW982 cells, and RA-like fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) were employed to investigate the effect and possible mechanism of osthole on arthritis in vivo and in vitro. Results 20 and 40 mg/kg osthole significantly alleviated collagen-induced arthritic symptoms based on histopathology and clinical arthritis scores, and improved erosion using HE staining. 20 and 40 mg/kg osthole decreased the level of IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 in rats and ameliorated oxidative stress in serum evaluated using ELISA kits. In addition, treatment with 50 and 100 μM osthole for 48 h inhibited 10 ng/ml IL-1β-stimulated proliferation and migration of SW982, and significantly inhibited the expression of matrix metalloproteinases, such as MMP-1, MMP-3 and MMP-13, as detected by western blot. 50 and 100 μM osthole also blocked the generation of IL-6 and TNF-α in IL-1β-stimulated SW982 cells. The NF-κB and MAPK pathways were also inhibited by osthole in IL-1β-treated SW982 cells. Conclusion These results collectively demonstrated that osthole improves collagen-induced arthritis in a rat model and IL-1β-treated SW982 cells through inhibiting inflammation and cellular stress in vivo and in vitro, and osthole might be a promising therapeutic agent for RA.","Department of Osteology, YeDa Hospital, Taishan Road No. 11 Economic and Technological District of Yantai; Department of Osteology, YeDa Hospital, Taishan Road No. 11 Economic and Technological District of Yantai; Department of Osteology, YeDa Hospital, Taishan Road No. 11 Economic and Technological District of Yantai; School of Pharmacy, Jiangsu university; Department of Osteology, YeDa Hospital, Taishan Road No. 11 Economic and Technological District of Yantai",Cellular & Molecular Biology Letters

Based on agent-based simulations, we establish the connection between emerging spatiotemporal patterns and the homophily parameters. Key results are presented in a novel phase diagram, which reveals a wide range of spatial patterns including the cell, worm, herd, amoeba, and swarm modes under the dynamic regime and the separation, ghetto, and integration modes under the stationary one. Our model thus provides a generalized framework encompassing both static equilibrium and nonstationary systems to investigate the impact of agent heterogeneity on population dynamics. We demonstrate potential applications of our model to social systems using sexual segregation of ungulate habitats as a case study.","School of Mechanical Engineering, Yeungnam University,Gyeongsangbuk-do 712-749, Republic of Korea; School of Public Policy and Management, Korea Development Institute (KDI), 87 Hoegiro Dongdaemun, Seoul 130-868, Republic of Korea",Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society

This spice is obtained from the root of Curcuma longa L which is a member of ginger family. The present study aimed at introducing turmeric and its active constituent Curcumin, and investigating the effectiveness of its therapeutic applications especially in dermal wound healing process based on traditional and conventional medicine resources. In the view of traditional medicine, turmeric has antibacterial effects and was used to strengthen the eyes, alleviate liver obstruction and jaundice and improve edema. In modern medicine, the most important reason of using this herb to prevent or slow the progression of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, pulmonary and autoimmune diseases, as well as inflammatory bowel disease is attributed to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Skin regeneration and wound healing is a complex process which includes many cells as well as various processes such as proliferation, cell migration, matrix synthesis and contraction that ultimately leads to recovery of cellular structures and tissue layers. There are many recommendations in traditional medicine that suggest the use of turmeric as an antiseptic therapeutic agent is beneficial in treating the skin injuries and healing of wounds, as well as improving rash, and scabies. Based on the results of the studies reviewed in this paper, due to anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant and angiogenesis activities of curcumin and turmeric, they can accelerate wound healing and improve scars regardless of the type of the wound or the route of the administration of the agent. Also, one of the main effects of this plant on accelerating wound healing is due to its ability to regulation TGF-β1 signaling pathway.","

Qadori, Zuriati Ahmad Zukarnain, Zurina Mohd Hanapi, Shamala Subramaniam",FuMAM: Fuzzy-Based Mobile Agent Migration Approach for Data Gathering in Wireless Sensor Networks,2018,"A mobile agent (MA) was recently proposed to provide an alternative solution for traditional data gathering in wireless sensor networks. An MA is a software component that can migrate among network nodes by following an assigned itinerary (or path). Instead of transporting data from the nodes to the processing unit (e.g., sink) for data gathering, the MA visits each node, and thus, it performs data gathering locally. The MA has two types of itinerary planning: single-agent itinerary planning (SIP) and multi-agent itinerary planning (MIP). The MIP was introduced to address the drawbacks of the SIP in terms of task duration, energy consumption, and reliability. Despite the advantages of the MIP, determining the optimal itinerary for each MA in the MIP poses a considerable challenge. Most proposed itineraries adopt a static itinerary in which the nodes to be visited by the MA are predetermined at the sink node. The distance among nodes is the only parameter that has been used to determine the itinerary of the MA. Other parameters, such as the remaining energy and a number of neighbors, have not been considered. This omission can negatively impact MA migration and result in an unsuccessful MA round-trip, particularly when the remaining energy of the node is insufficient to transfer an MA to the next hop. In this paper, a fuzzy-based MA migration approach (FuMAM) is proposed to determine appropriate itinerary for an MA by considering three parameters: distance, remaining energy, and a number of neighbors. Simulation experiments show that the FuMAM approach improves the rate of the successful MA round-trip and network lifetime. Moreover, the proposed FuMAM approach outperforms the compared algorithms in terms of energy distribution usage among nodes.","Department of Wireless and Communication Technology, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia; Department of Wireless and Communication Technology, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia; Department of Wireless and Communication Technology, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia; Department of Wireless and Communication Technology, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia",IEEE Access

There is an urgent need for discovering novel antitumor agents or therapeutic strategies for SCLC. Materials and methods: We performed a screening method based on CCK-8 assay to screen 640 natural compounds for SCLC. The effects of Sanguinarine chloride on SCLC cell proliferation, colony formation, cell cycle, apoptosis, migration and invasion were determined. RNA-seq and bioinformatics analysis was performed to investigate the anti-SCLC mechanism of Sanguinarine chloride. Publicly available datasets and samples were analyzed to investigate the expression level of CDKN1A and its clinical significance. Loss of functional cancer cell models were constructed by shRNA-mediated silencing. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot were used to measure gene and protein expression. Immunohistochemistry staining was performed to detect the expression of CDKN1A, Ki67, and Cleaved caspase 3 in xenograft tissues. Results: We identified Sanguinarine chloride as a potential inhibitor of SCLC, which inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, cell cycle, cell migration and invasion, and promoted apoptosis of SCLC cells. Sanguinarine chloride played an important role in anti-SCLC by upregulating the expression of CDKN1A. Furthermore, Sanguinarine chloride in combination with panobinostat, or THZ1, or gemcitabine, or (+)-JQ-1 increased the anti-SCLC effect compared with either agent alone treatment. Conclusions: Our findings identified Sanguinarine chloride as a potential inhibitor of SCLC by upregulating the expression of CDKN1A. Sanguinarine chloride in combination with chemotherapy compounds exhibited strong synergism anti-SCLC properties, which could be further clinically explored for the treatment of SCLC.","Key Laboratory of Brain, Cognition and Education Sciences, Ministry of Education, China; Institute for Brain Research and Rehabilitation, South China Normal University, Tianhe District, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510631, China; Key Laboratory of Brain, Cognition and Education Sciences, Ministry of Education, China; Institute for Brain Research and Rehabilitation, South China Normal University, Tianhe District, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510631, China; The Research Center of Basic Integrative Medicine, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou 510006, China; The Research Center of Basic Integrative Medicine, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou 510006, China; Key Laboratory of Brain, Cognition and Education Sciences, Ministry of Education, China; Institute for Brain Research and Rehabilitation, South China Normal University, Tianhe District, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510631, China; Key Laboratory of Brain, Cognition and Education Sciences, Ministry of Education, China; Institute for Brain Research and Rehabilitation, South China Normal University, Tianhe District, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510631, China; Key Laboratory of Brain, Cognition and Education Sciences, Ministry of Education, China; Institute for Brain Research and Rehabilitation, South China Normal University, Tianhe District, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510631, China; State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510120, China; Corresponding authors.; Key Laboratory of Brain, Cognition and Education Sciences, Ministry of Education, China; Institute for Brain Research and Rehabilitation, South China Normal University, Tianhe District, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510631, China; Corresponding authors.",Translational Oncology

Optimal control strategies aimed to solve these problems are effective only when updated information about system's components is available. However, gathering this information from many distributed components of a cloud system, such as physical nodes or virtual machines may significantly decrease overall performance. These problems can be solved by applying different optimization techniques such as multi-agent approach. Agents decide if the information is outdated and needs to be updated by them.

Multimodal treatment is empiric and prognosis remains poor. Recurrent PIK3CA missense mutations (PIK3CAmut) in GBM are restricted to three functional domains: adaptor binding (ABD), helical, and kinase. Defining how these mutations influence gliomagenesis and response to kinase inhibitors may aid in the clinical development of novel targeted therapies in biomarker-stratified patients.<h4>Methods</h4>We used normal human astrocytes immortalized via expression of hTERT, E6, and E7 (NHA). We selected two PIK3CAmut from each of 3 mutated domains and induced their expression in NHA with (NHARAS) and without mutant RAS using lentiviral vectors. We then examined the role of PIK3CAmut in gliomagenesis in vitro and in mice, as well as response to targeted PI3K (PI3Ki) and MEK (MEKi) inhibitors in vitro.<h4>Results</h4>PIK3CAmut, particularly helical and kinase domain mutations, potentiated proximal PI3K signaling and migration of NHA and NHARAS in vitro. Only kinase domain mutations promoted NHA colony formation, but both helical and kinase domain mutations promoted NHARAS tumorigenesis in vivo. PIK3CAmut status had minimal effects on PI3Ki and MEKi efficacy. However, PI3Ki/MEKi synergism was pronounced in NHA and NHARAS harboring ABD or helical mutations.<h4>Conclusion</h4>PIK3CAmut promoted differential gliomagenesis based on the mutated domain. While PIK3CAmut did not influence sensitivity to single agent PI3Ki, they did alter PI3Ki/MEKi synergism. Taken together, our results demonstrate that a subset of PIK3CAmut promote tumorigenesis and suggest that patients with helical domain mutations may be most sensitive to dual PI3Ki/MEKi treatment.",NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN,PLoS ONE

Current treatment is palliative, making necessary the development of new therapeutic strategies to offer alternatives to patients. Therefore, endophytes represent an interesting source of natural metabolites with anticancer potential. These microorganisms reside in tissues of living plants and act to improve their growth. Evidence revealed that several medicinal plants are colonized by endophytic fungi producer of antitumor metabolites. Achyrocline satureioides is a Brazilian medicinal plant characterized by its properties against gastrointestinal disturbances, anticancer and antioxidant effects. However, there are no reports describing the endophytic composition of A. satureioides. The present study proposes the isolation of endophytic fungus from A. satureioides, extract preparation, phytochemical characterization and evaluation of its antiglioma potential. Our data showed that crude extracts of endophyte decreased glioma viability with IC50 values of 1.60–1.63 μg/mL to eDCM (dichloromethane extract) and 37.30–55.12 μg/mL to eEtAc (ethyl acetate extract), respectively. Crude extracts induced cell death by apoptosis with modulation of redox status. In order to bioprospect anticancer metabolites, endophytic fungus extracts were subjected to guided fractionation and purification yielded five fractions of each extract. Six of ten fractions showed selective antiproliferative activity against glioma cells, with IC50 values ranged from 0.95 to 131.3 μg/mL. F3DCM (from eDCM) and F3EtAc (from eEtAc) fractions promoted C6 glioma toxicity with IC50 of 1.0 and 27.05 μg/mL, respectively. F3EtAc fraction induced late apoptosis and arrest in G2/M stage, while F3DCM promoted apoptosis with arrest in Sub-G1 phase. Moreover, F3DCM increased antioxidant defense and decreased ROS production. Additionally, F3DCM showed no cytotoxic activity against astrocytes, revealing selective effect. Based on promising potential of F3DCM, we identified the production of Sch-642305, a lactone, which showed antiproliferative properties with IC50 values of 1.1 and 7.6 μg/mL to C6 and U138MG gliomas, respectively. Sch-642305 promoted arrest on cell cycle in G2/M inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, this lactone decreased glioma cell migration and modulated redox status, increasing superoxide dismutase and catalase activities and enhancing sulfhydryl content, consequently suppressing reactive species of oxygen generation. Taken together, these results indicate that metabolites produced by endophytic fungus isolated from A. satureioides have therapeutic potential as antiglioma agent.","Programa de Pós-Graduação em Bioquímica e Bioprospecção, Centro de Ciências Químicas, Farmacêuticas e de Alimentos, Universidade Federal de Pelotas, Pelotas, Brazil; Programa de Pós-Graduação em Bioquímica e Bioprospecção, Centro de Ciências Químicas, Farmacêuticas e de Alimentos, Universidade Federal de Pelotas, Pelotas, Brazil; Programa de Pós-Graduação em Bioquímica e Bioprospecção, Centro de Ciências Químicas, Farmacêuticas e de Alimentos, Universidade Federal de Pelotas, Pelotas, Brazil; Programa de Pós-Graduação em Bioquímica e Bioprospecção, Centro de Ciências Químicas, Farmacêuticas e de Alimentos, Universidade Federal de Pelotas, Pelotas, Brazil; Programa de Pós-Graduação em Bioquímica e Bioprospecção, Centro de Ciências Químicas, Farmacêuticas e de Alimentos, Universidade Federal de Pelotas, Pelotas, Brazil; Programa de Pós-Graduação em Bioquímica e Bioprospecção, Centro de Ciências Químicas, Farmacêuticas e de Alimentos, Universidade Federal de Pelotas, Pelotas, Brazil; Departamento de Ciências Básicas da Saúde, Universidade Federal de Ciências da Saúde de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Brazil; Embrapa Agroindústria Tropical, Fortaleza, Brazil; Embrapa Agroindústria Tropical, Fortaleza, Brazil; Embrapa Agroindústria Tropical, Fortaleza, Brazil; Embrapa Agroindústria Tropical, Fortaleza, Brazil; Programa de Pós-Graduação em Bioquímica e Bioprospecção, Centro de Ciências Químicas, Farmacêuticas e de Alimentos, Universidade Federal de Pelotas, Pelotas, Brazil; Programa de Pós-Graduação em Bioquímica e Bioprospecção, Centro de Ciências Químicas, Farmacêuticas e de Alimentos, Universidade Federal de Pelotas, Pelotas, Brazil; Programa de Pós-Graduação em Bioquímica e Bioprospecção, Centro de Ciências Químicas, Farmacêuticas e de Alimentos, Universidade Federal de Pelotas, Pelotas, Brazil; Programa de Pós-Graduação em Bioquímica e Bioprospecção, Centro de Ciências Químicas, Farmacêuticas e de Alimentos, Universidade Federal de Pelotas, Pelotas, Brazil; Departamento de Ciências Básicas da Saúde, Universidade Federal de Ciências da Saúde de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Brazil",Frontiers in Oncology
196,"Tao Sun, Salem Adra, Rod Smallwood, Mike Holcombe, Sheila MacNeil",Exploring hypotheses of the actions of TGF-beta1 in epidermal wound healing using a 3D computational multiscale model of the human epidermis.,2009,"In vivo and in vitro studies give a paradoxical picture of the actions of the key regulatory factor TGF-beta1 in epidermal wound healing with it stimulating migration of keratinocytes but also inhibiting their proliferation. To try to reconcile these into an easily visualized 3D model of wound healing amenable for experimentation by cell biologists, a multiscale model of the formation of a 3D skin epithelium was established with TGF-beta1 literature-derived rule sets and equations embedded within it. At the cellular level, an agent-based bottom-up model that focuses on individual interacting units (keratinocytes) was used. This was based on literature-derived rules governing keratinocyte behavior and keratinocyte/ECM interactions. The selection of these rule sets is described in detail in this paper. The agent-based model was then linked with a subcellular model of TGF-beta1 production and its action on keratinocytes simulated with a complex pathway simulator. This multiscale model can be run at a cellular level only or at a combined cellular/subcellular level. It was then initially challenged (by wounding) to investigate the behavior of keratinocytes in wound healing at the cellular level. To investigate the possible actions of TGF-beta1, several hypotheses were then explored by deliberately manipulating some of these rule sets at subcellular levels. This exercise readily eliminated some hypotheses and identified a sequence of spatial-temporal actions of TGF-beta1 for normal successful wound healing in an easy-to-follow 3D model. We suggest this multiscale model offers a valuable, easy-to-visualize aid to our understanding of the actions of this key regulator in wound healing, and provides a model that can now be used to explore pathologies of wound healing.",NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN,PLoS ONE

To investigate the underlying cell organisation principles of organoids, we imaged hundreds of pancreas and cholangiocarcinoma organoids in parallel using light sheet and bright-field microscopy for up to 7 days. Results We quantified organoid behaviour at single-cell (microscale), individual-organoid (mesoscale), and entire-culture (macroscale) levels. At single-cell resolution, we monitored formation, monolayer polarisation, and degeneration and identified diverse behaviours, including lumen expansion and decline (size oscillation), migration, rotation, and multi-organoid fusion. Detailed individual organoid quantifications lead to a mechanical 3D agent-based model. A derived scaling law and simulations support the hypotheses that size oscillations depend on organoid properties and cell division dynamics, which is confirmed by bright-field microscopy analysis of entire cultures. Conclusion Our multiscale analysis provides a systematic picture of the diversity of cell organisation in organoids by identifying and quantifying the core regulatory principles of organoid morphogenesis.","Physical Biology Group, Buchmann Institute for Molecular Life Sciences (BMLS), Goethe-Universität Frankfurt am Main; Physical Biology Group, Buchmann Institute for Molecular Life Sciences (BMLS), Goethe-Universität Frankfurt am Main; Physical Biology Group, Buchmann Institute for Molecular Life Sciences (BMLS), Goethe-Universität Frankfurt am Main; Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies and Faculty of Biological Sciences, Goethe-Universität Frankfurt am Main; Department of Physics, Goethe Universität Frankfurt am Main; Deanery of Biomedical Science, University of Edinburgh; Experimental Medicine and Therapy Research, University of Regensburg; Department of Surgery, Erasmus MC – University Medical Center; Department of Surgery, Erasmus MC – University Medical Center; The Wellcome Trust/CRUK Gurdon Institute, University of Cambridge; Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies and Faculty of Biological Sciences, Goethe-Universität Frankfurt am Main; Physical Biology Group, Buchmann Institute for Molecular Life Sciences (BMLS), Goethe-Universität Frankfurt am Main; Physical Biology Group, Buchmann Institute for Molecular Life Sciences (BMLS), Goethe-Universität Frankfurt am Main",BMC Biology

Harris",Assessing Population-Level Effects of Anthropogenic Disturbance on a Marine Mammal Population,2021,"The Population Consequences of Disturbance (PCoD) model is a conceptual framework used to assess the potential for population-level consequences following exposure of animals to a disturbance activity or stressor. This framework is a four-step process, progressing from changes in individual behavior and/or physiology, to changes in individual health, then vital rates, and finally to population-level effects. Despite its simplicity, there are few complete PCoD models available for any marine mammal species due to a lack of data available to parameterize many of the steps. Here, we present an application of the PCoD framework for migrating humpback whales exposed to a simulated commercial seismic survey scenario. We approached the framework in two ways; first, progressing sequentially forwards through the steps and basing our assessment on lactating females. This cohort was considered to be the most vulnerable in terms of energetic costs of disturbance, and most likely to influence any change in population growth due to future breeding success. Field measurements of behavioral responses of migrating humpback whales to seismic air guns from a previous study were used to parameterize an agent-based model (ABM). This ABM was used to estimate the probability of response, where a response was defined as a change in the migratory movement of female-calf pairs, and the duration of any resulting delay in migration. We then estimated the energetic consequences of any delay in migration for the lactating females and created population growth models with which to assess any population-level effects. The results of the forwards approach suggested a low potential for population consequences of seismic surveys on migrating humpbacks. Working backwards through the framework, we investigated “worst case” scenarios that could potentially lead to a population-level effect. Here, we started with increasing calf mortality and assumed that an exposure time greater than 48 h would increase mortality risk. We determined the most likely context in which this exposure would occur (resting area) and then tested this context within an ABM. This backwards approach illustrates how the PCoD model can be used to make management decisions regarding animal populations and exposure to anthropogenic stressors.","Cetacean Ecology and Acoustics Laboratory, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; Marine Scotland, Edinburgh, United Kingdom; DHI A/S, Hørsholm, Denmark; Centre for Research into Ecological and Environmental Modeling, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, United Kingdom",Frontiers in Marine Science

The survival rate of the patient is still arguably low even with intensive treatment provided, plus with the inherent side effects from the chemotherapy, which gives more unfavorable outcomes. Hence, the search for potent anti-osteosarcoma agent with promising safety profile is still on going. Natural occurring substance like curcumin has gained a lot of attention due to its splendid safety profile as well as it pharmacological advantages such as anti-metastasis and anti-angiogenesis. However, natural curcumin was widely known for its poor cellular uptake, which undermines all potential that it possesses. This prompted the development of synthetically synthesized curcuminoid analog, known as (Z)-3-hydroxy-1-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylprop-2- en-1-one (DK1). In this present study, in vitro scratch assay, transwell migration/invasion assay, HUVEC tube formation assay, and ex vivo rat aortic ring assays were performed in order to investigate the anti-metastatic and anti-angiogenic potential of DK1. For further comprehension of DK1 mechanism on human osteosarcoma cell lines, microarray gene expression analysis, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and proteome profiler were adopted, providing valuable forecast from the expression of important genes and proteins related to metastasis and angiogenesis. Based on the data gathered from the bioassays, DK1 was able to inhibit the metastasis and angiogenesis of human osteosarcoma cell lines by significantly reducing the cell motility, number of migrated and invaded cells as well as the tube formation and micro-vessels sprouting. Additionally, DK1 also has significantly regulated several cancer pathways involved in OS proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis such as PI3K/Akt and NF-κB in both U-2 OS and MG-63. Regulation of PI3K/Akt caused up-regulation of genes related to metastasis inhibition, namely, PTEN, FOXO, PLK3, and GADD45A. Meanwhile, NF-κB pathway was regulated by mitigating the expression of NF-κB activator such as IKBKB and IKBKE in MG-63, whilst up-regulating the expression of NF-κB inhibitors such as NFKBIA and NFKBIE in U-2 OS. Finally, DK1 also has successfully hindered the metastatic and angiogenic capability of OS cell lines by down-regulating the expression of pro-metastatic genes and proteins like MMP3, COL11A1, FGF1, Endoglin, uPA, and IGFBP2 in U-2 OS. Whilst for MG-63, the significantly down-regulated oncogenes were Serpin E1, AKT2, VEGF, uPA, PD-ECGF, and Endoglin. These results suggest that curcumin analog DK1 may serve as a potential new anti-osteosarcoma agent due to its anti-metastatic and anti-angiogenic attributes.","Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; China-ASEAN College of Marine Sciences, Xiamen University Malaysia, Sepang 43900, Selangor, Malaysia; Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; Department of Chemistry, Ghazi University, Dera Ghazi Khan 32200, Pakistan; Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; Department of Biomedical Science, Faculty of Medicine and Health Science, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia",Pharmaceuticals

Interaction of β-catenin with Transcription factor 4 (TCF4) is a key step for the activation of Wnt genes in response to upstream signals of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Hence, down regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling or targeting downstream events by selective β-catenin/TCF4 protein–protein interaction inhibitors could be a potential therapeutic strategy against such cancers. In this study structure-based drug design approach was followed to design novel 4,7-disubstituted 8-methoxyquinazoline-based derivatives which could act as potential cytotoxic agents inhibiting the β-catenin/TCF4 protein–protein interactions. Fifteen compounds possessing 4,7-disubstituted 8-methoxyquinazoline scaffold were synthesized. Cytotoxic potential of the synthesised derivatives were determined against constitutively activated β-catenin/TCF4 signaling pathway cancer cells (HCT116 and HepG2) using the sulforhodamine B assay. The most potent compound (18B) was selected for detailed biological evaluation. Cell morphology, Hoechst 33342 and Annexin V/PI staining were used to detect apoptosis, while inhibition of cell migration was assessed by in vitro wound healing assay against HCT116 and HepG2 cells. Effect on β-catenin/TCF mediated transcriptional activity was assessed by TOPFlash/FOPFlash assay, TCF4 and β-catenin protein expression by immunocytofluorescence, and Wnt target genes (like c-MYC and Cyclin D1) mRNA levels by RT-PCR against HCT116 cells. Cytotoxic potency of the most potential compound (18B) against primary human gallbladder cancer cells was also evaluated. The derivatives showed interactions with active site residues of β-catenin and were capable of hindering the TCF4 binding, thereby disrupting β-catenin/TCF4 interactions. Cytotoxic potencies (IC50) of these derivatives ranged from 5.64 ± 0.68 to 23.18 ± 0.45 μM against HCT116 and HepG2 cells respectively. Compound (18B), the most potent compound among the series, induced apoptosis and inhibited cell migration against HCT116 and HepG2 cells. Mechanistic studies indicated that compound (18B) downregulated β-catenin/TCF4 signaling pathway, β-catenin and TCF4 protein expression, and mRNA levels of c-MYC andCyclin D1 in HCT116 cells and showed cytotoxicity against primary human gallbladder cancer cells with IC50 value of 8.50 ± 1.44 μM. Thus, novel 4,7-disubstituted 8-methoxyquinazoline derivatives were identified as potential cytotoxic agents with potencies comparable to that of imatinib mesylate. Compound (18B) represents a promising lead molecule as anticancer agent against colon, hepatocellular and gallbladder cancers targeting β-catenin/TCF4 signaling pathway.","Department of Pharmaceutical Engineering and Technorlogy, Indian Institute of Technology (Banaras Hindu University), Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India; Faculty of Pharmacy, The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda, Vadodara, Gujarat, India; Department of Biotechnology, Bhupat and Jyoti Mehta School of Biosciences, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India; Department of Biotechnology, Bhupat and Jyoti Mehta School of Biosciences, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India; Department of Surgical Oncology, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India; Department of Biotechnology, Bhupat and Jyoti Mehta School of Biosciences, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India; Department of Pharmaceutical Engineering and Technorlogy, Indian Institute of Technology (Banaras Hindu University), Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India; Corresponding authors at: Prasanta Kumar Nayak, Department of Pharmaceutical Engineering and Technology, Indian Institute of Technology (Banaras Hindu University) Varanasi 221 005, Uttar Pradesh.

The low-risk alternative for women with uncomplicated SUI is the bulking agent, which aims to achieve continence through coaptation of the urethra. Two classes of bulking agents can be identified: those made from solid microparticles in an absorbable liquid or gel carrier (particulate agents) and those comprising a homogenous gel (non-particulates) that resists absorption. Polydimethylsiloxane&reg;, carbon-coated zirconium oxide&reg;, calcium hydroxyapatite&reg; and polyacrylate polyalcohol copolymer&reg; are currently marketed particulate agents. With the exception of calcium hydroxyapatite, the particles are non-degradable. Each agent achieves its long-term bulking effect through reactive changes around the persisting particles while the carrier volume is lost. Bulkamid&reg; is a non-particulate agent with the bulking effect resulting from the volume of gel injected. The lasting network of fine fibers formed by the host tissue anchors the gel in situ. Foreign-body granulomas, erosion and migration/material extrusion and loss of bulk have been observed in connection with the particle-based products. Bulkamid may be mechanistically less liable to these events; however, there are minimal data directly comparing the two types of bulking agent. The question of durability is inevitable based on their differing modes of action.Keywords: stress urinary incontinence, bulking agents, safety, particulate, non-particulate",NaN; NaN,Research and Reports in Urology

In this study, we evaluated AdoMet-induced modulation of miRNA-34c and miRNA-449a expression in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 TNBC cells. We demonstrated that AdoMet upregulates miR-34c and miR-449a expression in both cell lines.

The mechanism of how casticin affects melanoma cell migration and invasion is still not well known. Here we studied the anti-metastasis effects of casticin on A375.S2 melanoma cells by using a non-lethal concentration. First; we used an adhesion assay to test the A375.S2 cells&#x2019; adhesion ability after treatment with casticin. We next investigated the cell migration ability after casticin treatment by using a wound healing assay to prove that the migration of A375.S2 cells can be inhibited by casticin and double checked the results using the transwell-migration assay. The suppressive effects on matrix metalloproteinase-2; and -9 (MMP-2; and -9) activities were examined by gelatin zymography. Furthermore, western blotting was used to investigate the protein level changes in A375.S2 cells. We found that p-EGFR; Ras and p-ERK1/2 are decreased by casticin, indicating that casticin can down-regulate the migration and invasion ability of A375.S2 cells via the p-EGFR/Ras/p-ERK pathway. The NF-&#x3BA;B p65 and p-ERK levels in nuclear proteins are also decreased by treatment with casticin. An EMSA assay also discovered that the NF-&#x3BA;B p65 and DNA interaction is decreased. NF-&#x3BA;B p65 protein level was examined by immunofluorescence staining and also decreased. Our findings suggest that casticin has anti-metastatic potential by decreasing the invasiveness of A375.S2 cells. We also found that casticin suppressed A375.S2 cell proliferation and cell adhesion ability, but did not affect cell death, as examined using cytometry and a collagen adhesion assay.

Increased heterogeneity is argued to decrease trust and diversify interests between resource users, leading to overuse and decline of natural and man-made CPRs. The aim of this paper is to understand cooperative behaviour under economic and sociocultural heterogeneity in CPRs, through the analyses of experimental data including 344 subjects from the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, and 144 subjects from India. Multilevel regression, ordinal logistic regression, linear conditional-contribution profiles [LCPs] and agent-based models [ABMs] are used to analyse and replicate experimental outcomes on the micro- and macro-level. Results show that the combination of economic and sociocultural heterogeneity affects cooperation negatively when the decision-situation is perceived as unfair, but that neither economic nor sociocultural heterogeneity on themselves affect cooperation negatively. Economic heterogeneity is even found to affect cooperation positively relative to homogeneity. Player type classification based on LCP scores shows that experimental outcomes can be interpreted with player types, and ABM simulations validate the experimental results by replicating the main outcomes.",NaN,PLoS ONE

The paracrine mechanism of the cellular component is considered to play a critical role in the regenerative properties of these tissues. However, cell-based therapy for clinical application has been hindered by limitations such as safety, immunogenicity issues, and difficulties in cell preservation, transportation, and phenotype control. In the current study, we aimed to produce a cell-free extract directly from human fat tissue and evaluate its potential therapeutic efficacy. Methods We developed a novel physical approach to produce a cell-free aqueous extract from human fat tissue (fat extract (FE)). The therapeutic potential of FE was investigated in the ischemic hindlimb model of nude mice. After establishment of hindlimb ischemia with ligation of the left femoral artery and intramuscular injection of FE, blood perfusion was monitored at days 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28. Tissue necrosis and capillary density were evaluated. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to analyze the growth factors contained in FE. Moreover, the proliferation, migration, and tube formation ability were tested on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro when treated with FE. The proangiogenic ability of FE was further assessed in an in-vivo Matrigel plug assay. Results FE was prepared and characterized. The intramuscular injection of FE into the ischemic hindlimb of mice attenuated severe limb loss and increased blood flow and capillary density of the ischemic tissue. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that FE contained high levels of various growth factors. When added as a cell culture supplement, FE promoted HUVEC proliferation, migration, and tube formation ability in a dose-dependent manner.

Vitamins are one of the most important micronutrients, which play great roles in many biochemical reactions inside the cells and cell pathways affecting various cellular functions. Here the effects of essential vitamins on angiogenesis are overviewed. An electronic search was performed in PubMed database via OVID from January 2000 to February 2017 using the keywords regarding the effects of vitamins on angiogenesis. Of the 911 articles found in our initial search only 126 met the inclusion criteria. Vitamin A, both 13-cis retinoid acid and acyclic acid inhibit angiogenesis by suppressing VEGF, while all trans retinoid acid induces angiogenesis by enhancing the expression of proangiogenic factors and reducing pro-MMP2 activity. Vitamin B1, Thiamine, simulates angiogenesis by inducing proliferation of human endothelial progenitor cells and inhibiting apoptosis via PKB/Akt-mediated potentiation. Vitamin B2, Riboflavin, inhibits angiogenesis by decreasing phosphorylation of Src tyrosine 16, an activator residue of Src kinase, and a key player in angiogenesis. Vitamin B3, Niacin, acts as a proangiogenic substance by acting as a precursor of NAD+, as well as promoting endothelial cell function via its receptor GPR109A. Vitamin B6 inhibits angiogenesis by inhibiting micro vessel outgrowth and suppressing the proliferation of endothelial cells. Vitamin B9, Folic acid, inhibits angiogenesis by decreasing proliferation of endothelial cells, as well as activating Src/ERK2/NF-κB/p53 signaling pathways, resulting in cell cycle arrest. Vitamin B12, Cobalamin, acts as a pro-angiogenic substance by inducing production of NO, prostaglandin E1, and prostacyclin leading to angiogenesis. Furthermore, vitamin B12 reduces homocysteine levels in plasma, which is a significant anti-angiogenesis agent. Vitamin C in high concentrations alters the metabolic activity of endothelial cells; decreasing their ATP levels and cell proliferation. Thus, vitamin C has anti-angiogenic properties. Vitamin D in the 1,25D3 form has anti-proliferative effects by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Vitamin E, Tocopherols, exhibit anti-angiogenic effects by inhibition of proliferation and tube formation of endothelial cells through suppression of signaling pathways that are dependent on activation of PI3K/PDK/Akt signaling. Vitamin K exhibits its antiangiogenic activity by acting on protein S, through inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor-receptor 2 (VEGFR2)-dependent vascularization as well as VEGF induced endothelial cell migration and proliferation.According to the studies evaluated here, vitamins A, B, C, D, E and K exhibit pro- or anti-angiogenic activities based on their derivatives and physiological settings. Vitamin A shows both anti- and pro-angiogenesis activity while Vitamins B2, B6, B9, C, D, E and K have anti-angiogenic properties and Vitamins B1 and B3 are proangiogenesis.","Departments of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, United States; Departments of Biomedical Engineering, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, United States; Corresponding author at: Department of Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Sciences, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public health, 1111 Highland Avenue, 9418 WIMR, Madison, WI 53705, United States.; Angiogenesis and Regenerative Sector, Dr. H.

Bowen","Combining Models of Environment, Behavior, and Physiology to Predict Tissue Hydrogen and Oxygen Isotope Variance Among Individual Terrestrial Animals",2020,"Variations in stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios in terrestrial animal tissues are used to reconstruct origin and movement. An underlying assumption of these applications is that tissues grown at the same site share a similar isotopic signal, representative of the location of their origin. However, large variations in tissue isotopic compositions often exist even among conspecific individuals within local populations, which complicates origin and migration inferences. Field-data and correlation analyses have provided hints about the underlying mechanisms of within-site among-individual isotopic variance, but a theory explaining the causes and magnitude of such variance has not been established. Here we develop a mechanistic modeling framework that provides explicit predictions of the magnitude, patterns, and drivers of isotopic variation among individuals living in a common but environmentally heterogeneous habitat. The model toolbox includes isoscape models of environmental isotopic variability, an agent-based model of behavior and movement, and a physiology-biochemistry model of isotopic incorporation into tissues. We compare model predictions against observed variation in hatch-year individuals of the songbird Spotted Towhee (Pipilo maculatus) in Red Butte Canyon, Utah, and evaluate the ability of the model to reproduce this variation under different sets of assumptions. Only models that account for environmental isotopic variability predict a similar magnitude of isotopic variation as observed. Within the modeling framework, behavioral rules and properties govern how animals nesting in different locations acquire resources from different habitats, and birds nesting in or near riparian habitat preferentially access isotopically lighter resources than those associated with the meadow and slope habitats, which results in more negative body water and tissue isotope values. Riparian nesters also have faster body water turnover and acquire more water from drinking (vs. from food), which exerts a secondary influence on their isotope ratios. Thus, the model predicts that local among-individual isotopic variance is linked first to isotopic heterogeneity in the local habitat, and second to how animals sample this habitat during foraging. Model predictions provide insight into the fundamental mechanisms of small-scale isotopic variance and can be used to predict the utility of isotope-based methods for specific groups or environments in ecological and forensic research.","Department of Geology and Geophysics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, United States; Department of Integrative Marine Ecology, Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn, Fano Marine Centre, Naples, Italy; Department of Biology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States; Department of Integrative Biology, University of Colorado Denver, Denver, CO, United States; School of Ocean and Earth Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom; Department of Geology and Geophysics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, United States; Department of Geography, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, United States; Department of Geography, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, United States; Department of Biology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, United States; Department of Surgery, University of Utah Health, Salt Lake City, UT, United States; Department of Biology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, United States; College of Sciences, Koç University, Istanbul, Turkey; 0Department of Zoology, Conservation Science Group, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom; Department of Geology and Geophysics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, United States",Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution

In this work, we carried out fundamental in vitro and in vivo experiments to assess the labeling efficacy of our novel theranostic nanoprobe, consisting of glycogen conjugated with a red fluorescent probe and gadolinium. Microscopy and resazurin viability assays were used to study cell labeling and cell viability in human metastatic melanoma cell lines. Fluorescence lifetime correlation spectroscopy (FLCS) was done to investigate nanoprobe stability. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to study T1 relaxivity in vitro, and contrast enhancement in a subcutaneous in vivo tumor model. Efficient cell labeling was demonstrated, while cell viability, cell migration, and cell growth was not affected. FLCS showed that the nanoprobe did not degrade in blood plasma. MRI demonstrated that down to 750 cells/μL of labeled cells in agar phantoms could be detected. In vivo MRI showed that contrast enhancement in tumors was comparable between Omniscan contrast agent  and the nanoprobe.

Concentration-effect curves for the influence of GJH on cellular proliferation showed a biphasic shape. Besides, GJH had a synergistic effect on cytotoxicity when combined with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)which may be due to the alternation of the chemotherapeutic agent resistance-related genes and due to the synergistic effects on apoptosis. In addition, treatment with GJH extract markedly reduced 786-O cell adherence to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and decreased 786-O cell migration and invasion. In a xenograft animal model, GJH extract had an inhibitory effect on tumor cell-induced metastasis. Moreover, western blot analysis showed that the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in 786-O cells was significantly decreased by treatment with GJH extract through inactivation of nuclear factor-κB (NF--κB). These results suggest that GJH extract has a synergistic effect on apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents and an inhibitory effect on cell adhesion, migration, and invasion, providing evidence for the use of water-based extracts of GJH as novel alternative therapeutic agents in the treatment of human renal cancer.","Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan; Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan; Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan; Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan; Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan; Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan; Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan; Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan; Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan",Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine

Prion diseases may arise spontaneously, be inherited genetically or be acquired by infection and affect a variety of mammalian species including humans. Prion infections in the central nervous system (CNS) cause extensive neuropathology, including abnormal accumulations of misfolded host prion protein, vacuolar change resulting in sponge-like (spongiform) appearance of CNS tissue, neurodegeneration and reactive glial responses. Many different prion agent strains exist and these can differ based on disease duration, clinical signs and the targeting and distribution of the neuropathology in distinct brain areas. Reactive astrocytes are a prominent feature in the prion disease affected CNS as revealed by distinct morphological changes and upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). The CD44 antigen is a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in cell-cell interactions, cell adhesion and migration. Here we show that CD44 is also highly expressed in a subset of reactive astrocytes in regions of the CNS targeted by prions. Astrocyte heterogeneity revealed by differential CD44 upregulation occurs coincident with the earliest neuropathological changes during the pre-clinical phase of disease, and is not affected by the route of infection. The expression and distribution of CD44 was compared in brains from a large collection of 15 distinct prion agent strains transmitted to mice of different prion protein (Prnp) genotype backgrounds. Our data show that the pattern of CD44 upregulation observed in the hippocampus in each prion agent strain and host Prnp genotype combination was unique. Many mouse-adapted prion strains and hosts have previously been characterized based on the pattern of the distribution of the spongiform pathology or the misfolded PrP deposition within the brain. Our data show that CD44 expression also provides a reliable discriminatory marker of prion infection with a greater dynamic range than misfolded prion protein deposition, aiding strain identification. Together, our data reveal CD44 as a novel marker to detect reactive astrocyte heterogeneity during CNS prion disease and for enhanced identification of distinct prion agent strains.",NaN; NaN; NaN,Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience

Mutsaers",Combination therapy with cannabidiol and chemotherapeutics in canine urothelial carcinoma cells,2021,"<h4>Background</h4> Canine urothelial carcinoma is the most common form of canine bladder cancer. Treatment with chemotherapy has variable response rates leading to most dogs succumbing to their disease within a year. Cannabidiol is an emerging treatment within the field of oncology. In reported in vivo studies, cannabidiol has induced apoptosis, reduced cell migration, and acted as a chemotherapy sensitizer in various human tumor types. The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of cannabidiol on canine urothelial carcinoma cell viability and apoptosis as both a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy in vitro. <h4>Results</h4> Cannabidiol reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis in canine urothelial cells as determined by crystal violet viability assay and annexin V/propidium iodide flow cytometry. Furthermore, combinations of cannabidiol with mitoxantrone and vinblastine chemotherapy yielded significantly reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis compared to single agent treatment alone. The drug interactions were deemed synergistic based on combination index calculations. Conversely, the combination of cannabidiol and carboplatin did not result in decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis compared to single agent treatment. Combination index calculations suggested an antagonistic interaction between these drugs. Finally, the combination of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug piroxicam with cannabidiol did not significantly affect cell viability, although, some cell lines demonstrated decreased cell viability when mitoxantrone was combined with piroxicam. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Cannabidiol showed promising results as a single agent or in combination with mitoxantrone and vinblastine for treatment of canine urothelial carcinoma cells.

Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is major cancer type due to its poor prognosis even after treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs, which causes a variety of side effects in patients. Therefore, efforts have been made to develop effective biomarkers in the treatment of HCC in order to improve therapeutic outcomes using natural based agents. The current study used SCU as a treatment approach against HCC using the HepG2 cell line. Based on the cell viability assessment up to a 200 μM concentration of SCU, three low-toxic concentrations of (25, 50, and 100) μM were adopted for further investigation. SCU induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and inhibited cell migration and proliferation in HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, increased PTEN expression by SCU led to the subsequent downregulation of PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway related proteins. In addition, SCU regulated the metastasis with EMT and migration-related proteins in HepG2 cells. In summary, SCU inhibits cell proliferation and metastasis in HepG2 cells through PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling by upregulation of PTEN, suggesting that SCU might be used as a potential agent for HCC therapy.","Research Institute of Life Science and College of Veterinary Medicine, Gyeongsang National University, Gazwa Campus, 501 Jinju-daero, Jinju 52828, Korea; Research Institute of Life Science and College of Veterinary Medicine, Gyeongsang National University, Gazwa Campus, 501 Jinju-daero, Jinju 52828, Korea; Research Institute of Life Science and College of Veterinary Medicine, Gyeongsang National University, Gazwa Campus, 501 Jinju-daero, Jinju 52828, Korea; Research Institute of Life Science and College of Veterinary Medicine, Gyeongsang National University, Gazwa Campus, 501 Jinju-daero, Jinju 52828, Korea; Research Institute of Life Science and College of Veterinary Medicine, Gyeongsang National University, Gazwa Campus, 501 Jinju-daero, Jinju 52828, Korea; Biological Resources Research Group, Gyeongnam Department of Environment Toxicology and Chemistry, Korea Institute of Toxicology, 17 Jegok-gil, Jinju 52834, Korea; Biological Resources Research Group, Gyeongnam Department of Environment Toxicology and Chemistry, Korea Institute of Toxicology, 17 Jegok-gil, Jinju 52834, Korea; Research Institute of Life Science and College of Veterinary Medicine, Gyeongsang National University, Gazwa Campus, 501 Jinju-daero, Jinju 52828, Korea",International Journal of Molecular Sciences

In the lung, it is able to quickly adapt to the humid environment and, if not removed within a time frame of 4-8 hours, the pathogen may cause damage by germination and invasive growth. Applying a to-scale agent-based model of human alveoli to simulate early A. fumigatus infection under physiological conditions, we recently demonstrated that alveolar macrophages require chemotactic cues to accomplish the task of pathogen detection in time. The objective of this study is to specify our phenomenological prediction on the as yet unidentified chemokine by a quantitative analysis of its expected properties, such as the diffusion coefficient and the rates of secretion and degradation. To this end, the rule-based implementation of chemokine diffusion in the initial agent-based model is revised by numerically solving the spatio-temporal reaction-diffusion equation in the complex structure of the alveolus. In this hybrid agent-based model, alveolar macrophages are represented as migrating agents that are coupled to the interactive layer of diffusing molecule concentrations by the kinetics of chemokine receptor binding, internalization and re-expression. Performing simulations for more than a million virtual infection scenarios, we find that the ratio of secretion rate to the diffusion coefficient is the main indicator for the success of pathogen detection. Moreover, a subdivision of the parameter space into regimes of successful and unsuccessful parameter combination by this ratio is specific for values of the migration speed and the directional persistence time of alveolar macrophages, but depends only weakly on chemokine degradation rates.",Leibniz-Institute for Natural Product Research and Infection Biology -Hans-Knoell-Institute; Leibniz-Institute for Natural Product Research and Infection Biology -Hans-Knoell-Institute,Frontiers in Microbiology
214,"Johannes Pollmächer, Marc Thilo Figge",Agent-based model of human alveoli predicts chemotactic signaling by epithelial cells during early Aspergillus fumigatus infection.,2014,"Aspergillus fumigatus is one of the most important human fungal pathogens, causing life-threatening diseases. Since humans inhale hundreds to thousands of fungal conidia every day, the lower respiratory tract is the primary site of infection. Current interaction networks of the innate immune response attribute fungal recognition and detection to alveolar macrophages, which are thought to be the first cells to get in contact with the fungus. At present, these networks are derived from in vitro or in situ assays, as the peculiar physiology of the human lung makes in vivo experiments, including imaging on the cell-level, hard to realize. We implemented a spatio-temporal agent-based model of a human alveolus in order to perform in silico experiments of a virtual infection scenario, for an alveolus infected with A. fumigatus under physiological conditions. The virtual analog captures the three-dimensional alveolar morphology consisting of the two major alveolar epithelial cell types and the pores of Kohn as well as the dynamic process of respiration. To the best of our knowledge this is the first agent-based model of a dynamic human alveolus in the presence of respiration. A key readout of our simulations is the first-passage-time of alveolar macrophages, which is the period of time that elapses until the first physical macrophage-conidium contact is established. We tested for random and chemotactic migration modes of alveolar macrophages and varied their corresponding parameter sets. The resulting first-passage-time distributions imply that randomly migrating macrophages fail to find the conidium before the start of germination, whereas guidance by chemotactic signals derived from the alveolar epithelial cell associated with the fungus enables a secure and successful discovery of the pathogen in time.",NaN; NaN,PLoS ONE

Emerging evidence suggests that ZA has anti-tumor and anti-metastatic properties for breast cancer cells. In a mouse model of ZA-related osteonecrosis of the jaw, ZA administration was found to suppress regulatory T-cells (Tregs) function. Our previous reports also demonstrated ZA acted as an immune modulator to block Tregs. Manipulation of Tregs represents a new strategy for cancer treatment. However, the relationship among ZA, Tregs, and cancer cells remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of ZA on the interaction of breast cancer cells and Tregs. Methods The anti-tumor effect of ZA on triple negative breast cancer cell lines were validated by XTT, wound healing and apoptosis analysis. A flow cytometry-based assay was used to analyze the immunosuppressive effect of Tregs treated with media conditioned by breast cancer cells, and a transwell assay was used to evaluate the chemotactic migration of Tregs. Differential gene expression profile on MDA-MB-231 treated with ZA (25 μM) was analyzed by. microarrays to describe the molecular basis of actions of ZA for possible direct anti-tumor effects. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and quantitative real-time PCR were used to investigate the effect of ZA on the expression of cytokines/factors by breast cancer cells. Results ZA was found to inhibit the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. Media conditioned by the MDA-MB-231 cells promoted the expansion, chemotactic migration, and immunosuppressive activity of Tregs, and these effects were attenuated in a dose-dependent manner by ZA treatment, and the attenuation was due to reduced expression of selected breast cancer cell factors (CCL2, CCL5, and IDO). Conclusions ZA can significantly affect the interaction between breast cancer cells and Tregs. Our findings indicate that ZA is a potential therapeutic agent that can be used to reduce cancer aggressiveness by abolishing the supportive role of Tregs.","Department of Surgery, Chi Mei Medical Center; Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology; Department of Surgery, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital; Department of Medical Laboratory Science, I-Shou University; Department of Medical Laboratory Science, I-Shou University",BMC Cancer

These patterns are the result of chemical gradients that are created from the directed movement and metabolic activity of billions of cells. A recent study on pattern formation in wild bacterial isolates has revealed unique collective behaviors of the bacteria Enterobacter cloacae. As in other bacterial species, Enterobacter cloacae form macroscopic aggregates. Once formed, these bacterial clusters can migrate several millimeters, sometimes resulting in the merging of two or more clusters. To better understand these phenomena, we examine the formation and dynamics of thousands of bacterial clusters that form within a 22 cm square culture dish filled with soft agar over two days. At the macroscale, the aggregates display spatial order at short length scales, and the migration of cell clusters is superdiffusive, with a merging acceleration that is correlated with aggregate size. At the microscale, aggregates are composed of immotile cells surrounded by low density regions of motile cells. The collective movement of the aggregates is the result of an asymmetric flux of bacteria at the boundary. An agent-based model is developed to examine how these phenomena are the result of both chemotactic movement and a change in motility at high cell density.

However, the practical application of aqueous ZIBs at low temperature environment is hindered by the freezing aqueous electrolytes, which leads to a sharp drop in ionic conductivity, and thereby a rapid deterioration of battery performance. Herein, a chaotropic salt electrolyte based on low concentration aqueous Zn(ClO4)2 with superior ionic conductivity under low temperature (4.23 mS/cm at −50°C) is reported. The anti‐freezing methodology introduced here is completely different from conventional freeze‐resistant design of using “water‐in‐salt” electrolyte, cosolvents, or anti‐freezing agent additives strategy. Experimental analysis and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the as‐prepared Zn(ClO4)2 electrolyte possesses faster ionic migration compared with other commonly used Zn‐based salts (i.e., Zn(CF3SO3)2 and ZnSO4) electrolyte. It is found that Zn(ClO4)2 electrolyte can suppress the ice crystal construction by forming more hydrogen bonds between solute ClO4− and solvent H2O molecules, thus leading to a superior anti‐freezing property. The fabricated ZIBs using this aqueous electrolyte exhibits a dramatically enhanced specific capacity, remarkable rate capability, and great cycling stability over a wide temperature range, from −50 to 25°C. The aqueous ZIBs also exhibit an outstanding energy density of 238.4 Wh/kg without compromising the power density (7.9 kW/kg) under −20°C. Moreover, the assembled aqueous ZIBs can also cycle stably over 1000 cycles at an ultra‐low −50°C. The high‐safety and cost‐effective chaotropic salt electrolyte presented here is a promising strategy for low temperature energy storage application.",School of Electronic and Computer Engineering Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School Shenzhen China; School of Electronic and Computer Engineering Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School Shenzhen China; School of Electrical Engineering and Automation Wuhan University Wuhan China; School of Electronic and Computer Engineering Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School Shenzhen China; Institute Charles Gerhardt Montpellier Universit'e Montpellier Montpellier France; School of Electronic and Computer Engineering Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School Shenzhen China; Institute Charles Gerhardt Montpellier Universit'e Montpellier Montpellier France; Zinergy Shenzhen Ltd.

In the State of Kuwait, there is a unique set of push and pull factors: government subsidised housing for citizens, the existence of a single urban area, and the initiation of a new and ambitious master plan for the construction of 12 new cities, which are expected to attract not only locals, but also international residents and businesses. On top of these factors, there is an unusual demographic situation, as non-citizens outnumber Kuwaiti citizens by a factor of 2.3, with these groups having widely different preferences in terms of housing. Currently, there is no plan to take these resident groups' opinions into consideration for the new cities project. Besides, the current study simulates the impacts of the involvement of residents in urban planning. Samples from resident groups (citizens and non-citizens) participated in targeted surveys and useful answers were extracted in relation to the migration likelihood, push and pull factors that may affect their decisions, spatial preferences for new cities and their opinions on segregation by nationality. Specifically, the survey results showed significant interest of residents in moving to the new cities. For citizens, the most important factors in deciding whether to move or not were proximity to their close family and housing availability, while for non-citizens the most important factor was the creation of new employment opportunities. Both survey groups agreed that existing city property prices are too high and make the prospect of moving to a new city more attractive. The responses were transferred in an Agent Based Model, and the simulations showed certain differences to the official projections for 2050 without the public responses, in regards to the geographical distribution of the most desirable suburbs. Furthermore, the simulations showed that in the new cities, nationality segregation levels are expected to drop by at least 15% compared to the 2015 levels. The findings may be utilised by the authorities to modify the master plan accordingly.",NaN; NaN; NaN,PLoS ONE

Disintegrins are small and cysteine-rich proteins present in snake venoms and can interact with specific integrins to inhibit their activities in cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions. These molecules, known to inhibit platelet aggregation, are also capable of interacting with certain cancer-related integrins, and may interfere in important processes involved in carcinogenesis. Therefore, disintegrin from Crotalus durissus collilineatus venom was isolated, structurally characterized and evaluated for its toxicity and ability to interfere with cell proliferation and migration in MDA-MB-231, a human breast cancer cell line. Methods Based on previous studies, disintegrin was isolated by FPLC, through two chromatographic steps, both on reversed phase C-18 columns. The isolated disintegrin was structurally characterized by Tris-Tricine-SDS-PAGE, mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing. For the functional assays, MTT and wound-healing assays were performed in order to investigate cytotoxicity and effect on cell migration in vitro, respectively. Results Disintegrin presented a molecular mass of 7287.4 Da and its amino acid sequence shared similarity with the disintegrin domain of P-II metalloproteases. Using functional assays, the disintegrin showed low cytotoxicity (15% and 17%, at 3 and 6 μg/mL, respectively) after 24 h of incubation and in the wound-healing assay, the disintegrin (3 μg/mL) was able to significantly inhibit cell migration (24%, p < 0.05), compared to negative control. Conclusion Thus, our results demonstrate that non-RGD disintegrin from C. d. collilineatus induces low cytotoxicity and inhibits migration of human breast cancer cells. Therefore, it may be a very useful molecular tool for understanding ECM-cell interaction cancer-related mechanisms involved in an important integrin family that highlights molecular aspects of tumorigenesis. Also, non-RGD disintegrin has potential to serve as an agent in anticancer therapy or adjuvant component combined with other anticancer drugs.","School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirão Preto, Department of Physics and Chemistry, University of São Paulo; School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirão Preto, Department of Physics and Chemistry, University of São Paulo; School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirão Preto, Department of Physics and Chemistry, University of São Paulo; School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirão Preto, Department of Physics and Chemistry, University of São Paulo; School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirão Preto, Department of Physics and Chemistry, University of São Paulo; Department of Clinical Analysis, Toxicology and Food Science, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirão Preto, University of São Paulo; Department of Clinical Analysis, Toxicology and Food Science, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirão Preto, University of São Paulo; Protein Chemistry Center and Department of Molecular and Cell Biology and Pathogenic Bioagents, School of Medicine of Ribeirão Preto, University of São Paulo; School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirão Preto, Department of Physics and Chemistry, University of São Paulo",Journal of Venomous Animals and Toxins including Tropical Diseases

However, radiation-induced tumor cell death is limited by a number of factors, including the adverse response of the tumor microenvironment to the treatment and either intrinsic or acquired mechanisms of evasive resistance, and the existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs).  In this study, we demonstrated that using different doses of irradiation led to the enrichment of CD133+ Mahlavu cells using flow cytometric method. Subsequently, CD133+ Mahlavu cells enriched by irradiation were characterized for their stemness gene expression, self-renewal, migration/invasion abilities,  and radiation resistance. Having established irradiation-enriched CD133+ Mahlavu cells with CSC properties, we evaluated a phytochemical, pterostilbene (PT), found abundantly in blueberries, against irradiation-enriched CSCs.  It was shown that PT treatment dose-dependently reduced the enrichment of CD133+ Mahlavu cells upon irradiation; PT treatment also prevented tumor sphere formation, reduced stemness gene expression, and suppressed invasion and migration abilities as well as increasing apoptosis of CD133+ Mahlavu CSCs. Based on our experimental data, pterostilbene could be used to prevent the enrichment of CD133+ hepatoma CSCs and should be considered for future clinical testing as a combined agent for HCC patients.","Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei 11031, Taiwan; Departments of Surgery, Taipei Medical University-Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei 23561, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11031, Taiwan; Department of Pathology, Taipei Medical University-Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei 23561, Taiwan; Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei 11031, Taiwan; Biostatistics and Research Consultation Center, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11031, Taiwan; Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei 115, Taiwan; Departments of Surgery, Taipei Medical University-Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei 23561, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11031, Taiwan; School of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11031, Taiwan; Departments of Surgery, Taipei Medical University-Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei 23561, Taiwan",Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine

Enterovirus infections can vary in clinical manifestations and severity, from asymptomatic infection to serious multisystem diseases. During evolution, enterovirus strains with increased neurovirulence or atypical pathogenicity may emerge exhibiting an epidemic potential. Recently, outbreaks of enterovirus infection with an increased rate of neurological manifestations, a significant percentage of severe cases and lethal outcomes have been observed worldwide, which were associated with enteroviruses EV-A71, EV-D68 etc. The World Health Organization has included EV-A71 and EV-D68 enterovirus infection together with some other dangerous viral diseases considered for inclusion in the List of Blueprint Priority Diseases. In connection with this, global enterovirus surveillance is important for controlling emergence and spread of epidemic enterovirus variants, prediction of establishing epidemic situation, timely conduction of preventive measures and vaccine development. A growing multi-field cooperation between Russia and Vietnam leads to increased two-way population migration, which actualizes scientific and practical collaboration in surveillance and control of infectious disease spread, including enterovirus infection. Currently, epidemiological surveillance of enterovirus infection in Vietnam is based on monitoring hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) rate, laboratory diagnostics of enterovirus infection and identification of enterovirus strains, mainly detected in severe patients. In 2001–2016, 34 non-polio virus types were identified in patients with enterovirus infection, largely represented by viruses EV-A71, CVA6, CVA10, and CVA16. Moreover, the peak incidence of enterovirus infection and related mortality rate were associated with the increased activity of EV-A71 virus. In Vietnam, EVA71 enterovirus of genotypes C1, C4, C5 and B5 circulated at different times. Over the last years, a new pandemic genotype virus CVA6 has been dominating as a causative agent of enterovirus infection in Vietnam as well as the majority of other countries. The data on phylogenetic relation between Vietnamese epidemic EV-A71 and CVA6 strains allowed to find that they underwent multiple betweencountry spreads, whereas their subsequent in-country dissemination resulted in 2011–2012 enterovirus outbreak and sustained high-level HFMD morbidity.","Blokhina Nizhny Novgorod Research institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology; Pasteur Institute of Ho Chi Minh City; St. Petersburg Pasteur Institute; Russian-Vietnamese Tropical research and technology center, South branch; Russian-Vietnamese Tropical research and technology center, Head office; St. Petersburg Pasteur Institute; St. Petersburg Pasteur Institute; Blokhina Nizhny Novgorod Research institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology",Infekciâ i Immunitet

Scaffold pores allow for cell mobility metabolic processes, and delivery of oxygen and nutrients by blood vessel. Thus, pore architecture affects cell seeding efficiency, cell viability, migration, morphology, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, angiogenesis, mechanical strength of scaffolds, and, eventually, bone formation. Therefore, to improve the efficacy of bone regeneration, several important parameters of the pore architecture of scaffolds must be carefully controlled, including pore size, geometry, orientation, uniformity, interconnectivity, and porosity, which are interrelated and whose coordination affects the effectiveness of bone tissue engineering. The honeycomb (HCB) as natural polymeric porogen is used to pore forming agent of scaffolds. It is unique for fully interconnected and oriented pores of uniform size and high mechanical strength in the direction of the pores. The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the effect of HCB concentration on macropore structure of the scaffolds. Methods Bioceramic hydroxyapatite (HA) was synthesized from abalone mussel shells (Halioitis asinina) using a precipitation method, and HA-based scaffolds were fabricated with honeycomb (HCB) as the porogen agent. Pore structure engineering was successfully carried out using HCB at concentrations of 10, 20, and 30 wt%. Results The Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS) analysis revealed that the Ca/P molar ratio of HA was 1.67 (the stoichiometric ratio of HA). The Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra results for porous HA-based scaffolds and synthesized HA showed that no chemical decomposition occurred in the HA-based scaffold fabrication process. The porosity of the scaffold tended to increase when higher concentrations of HCB were added. XRD data show that the HCB was completely degraded from the scaffold material. The cell metabolic activity and morphology of the HA + HCB 30 wt% scaffold enable it to facilitate the attachment of MC3T3E1 cells on its surface. Conclusion HCB 30 wt% is the best concentration to fabricate the scaffold corresponding to the criteria for pores structure, crystallographic properties, chemical decomposition process and cell viability for bone tissue engineering.","Department of physics, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science, Universitas Gadjah Mada; Integrated Laboratory for Research and Testing, Universitas Gadjah Mada; Department of physics, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science, Universitas Gadjah Mada; Department of Dental Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Dentistry, Universitas Gadjah Mada; Department of physics, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science, Universitas Gadjah Mada",Biomaterials Research

Salvianolic acid B (Sal B) has been demonstrated to be a potential chemoprevention agent for several cancers. Herein, we investigated the pharmacological function of Sal B on non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) metastasis. Methods. Two NSCLC cell lines (NCI-H2030 and NCI-H1650) were disposed of by 200 μM Sal B or 10 μM PKM2 agonist TEPP-46. Wound healing and transwell experiments were implemented for analyzing migratory and invasive capacities. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers β-catenin and E-cadherin were measured via western blotting. Cellular bioenergetics were evaluated with glucose uptake, lactate production, enolase activity, cellular ATP levels, as well as seahorse-based oxygen consumption rate (OCR), extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) analysis. Metabolic reprogramming markers PKM2, LDHA, and GLUT1 were detected via western blotting and immunofluorescence. Results. The results showed that Sal B disposal weakened the migration and invasion of NCI-H2030 and NCI-H1650 cells and inactivated the EMT process according to downregulation of β-catenin and upregulation of E-cadherin. Sal B-treated NSCLC cells displayed decreased glucose uptake, lactate production, enolase activity, cellular ATP levels, OCR, and ECAR, indicating a reduction in metabolic reprogramming. Additionally, Sal B downregulated the expression of PKM2, LDHA, and GLUT1. TEPP-46 may reverse the inhibitory effect of Sal B on metastasis as well as metabolic reprogramming. Conclusion. Our findings provide evidence that Sal B enables to weaken NSCLC metastasis through PKM2-independent metabolic reprogramming, which sheds light on the promising therapeutic usage of Sal B in treating NSCLC.",Department of Thoracic Surgery; Department of Thoracic Surgery; Department of Thoracic Surgery; Department of Thoracic Surgery,Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine

The islamophobic phenomenon increased radically in Poland during the peak of the migration crisis in the second half of 2015, following numerous press articles and columns which provide a background for such prejudice. The right-wing press titles provided space for authors voicing discriminative opinions about (mostly Muslim) refugees and immigrants from the Middle East and Northern Africa. Using a Discourse-Historical Approach (Wodak, Reisigl), the author analysed which predicational and referential strategies are used to designate social actors and where the line of distinction is drawn between the categories of ‘Us’ and ‘Them’ in right-wing press discourse on the migration crisis. The analysis suggests that right-wing publicists distinguish two diff erent subcategories of ‘Them’: a) refugees and immigrants (usually Muslim) and b) the liberal political and media elites. Therefore, the analysed texts could be perceived as examples of ‘conservative islamophobia’, as defi ned by Monika Bobako, in which European Christian identity is the basis for prejudice against Muslims and liberal advocates of multi-culturalism.",Uniwersytet Gdański,Studia Humanistyczne AGH

In this study, we evaluated the effect of PGV-1 on a highly metastatic breast cancer cell line, the 4T1 cells, as an anti-metastatic and anti-proliferative agent. Methods: Cell viability was evaluated using MTT assay; while cell cycle profile, apoptosis incidence, and ROS intracellular level were determined by flow cytometry. Cell senescence was observed under senescence-associated-β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining assay. The expression of matrixmetalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) was determined using immunoreaction based-ELISA, while other proteins expression were detected using immunoblotting. Results: Curcumin and PGV-1 showed cytotoxic effects on 4T1 cells with IC50 value of 50 and 4 µM, respectively. The cytotoxic activity of PGV-1 was correlated to the induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest and cell senescence. Furthermore, PGV-1 increased the accumulation of intracellular ROS level. We also revealed that PGV-1 bound to several ROS-metabolizing enzymes, including glyoxalase I (GLO1), peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1), N-ribosyldihydronicotinamide: quinone reductase 2 (NQO2), aldo-keto reductase family 1 member c1 (AKR1C1). As an antimetastatic agent, PGV-1 showed less inhibitory effect on cell migration compared to curcumin. However, PGV-1 significantly decreased MMP-9 protein expression in a dose-dependent manner suggesting it still potent to inhibit metastatic cells. Conclusion: Overall, our findings suggest that PGV-1 is potential to be developed as an antiproliferative and anti-metastatic agent.","Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta 55281 Indonesia.; Cancer Chemoprevention Research Center, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta 55281 Indonesia.; Cancer Chemoprevention Research Center, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta 55281 Indonesia.; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta 55281 Indonesia.; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta 55281 Indonesia.; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta 55281 Indonesia.; Cancer Chemoprevention Research Center, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta 55281 Indonesia.; Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan.; Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan.; Laboratory of Gene Function in Animals, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan.; Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan.",Advanced Pharmaceutical Bulletin

With the prosperous development of the mobile Internet and the rapid growth of the Internet of Things, various new applications continue to emerge, such as mobile payment, face recognition, wearable devices, driverless, VR/AR, etc. Although the computing power of mobile terminals is getting higher and the traditional cloud computing model has higher computing power, it is often accompanied by higher latency and cannot meet the needs of users. In order to reduce user delay to improve user experience, and at the same time reduce network load to a certain extent, edge computing, as an application of IOT, came into being. In view of the new architecture after dating edge computing, this paper focuses on the task offloading in edge computing, from task migration in multi-user scenarios and edge server resource management expansion, and proposes a multi-agent load balancing distribution based on deep reinforcement learning DTOMALB, a distributed task allocation algorithm, can perform a reasonable offload method for this scenario to improve user experience and balance resource utilization. Simulations show that the algorithm has a certain adaptability compared to the traditional algorithm in the scenario of multi-user single cell, and reduces the complexity of the algorithm compared to the centralized algorithm, and reduces the average response delay of the overall user. And balance the load of each edge computing server, improve the robustness and scalability of the system.","School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Key Laboratory of Communication and Information Systems, Beijing Municipal Commission of Education, Beijing Jiaotong University; School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Key Laboratory of Communication and Information Systems, Beijing Municipal Commission of Education, Beijing Jiaotong University; National Taipei University of Business; School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Key Laboratory of Communication and Information Systems, Beijing Municipal Commission of Education, Beijing Jiaotong University",EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking

Because the majority of the most common mid-latitude infections display a typical overt clinical picture, this problem has not been paid a proper attention until recently. Recent rise in incidence rate of infectious diseases lacking typical clinical signs observed lately makes it extremely important to consider the problem more closely. It is believed that such trend is due to a whole body of reasons, including impaired sanitary control, increased both internal and external migration flows, refusal of vaccination in case of long-lasting epidemic wellbeing, emergence of atypical bacterial strains of bacteria resulting from irrational antibiotic therapy etc. Viruses constitute the largest group of organisms on our planet accounting for them as the most common causative agent of infectious diseases of unknown etiology. Some estimates obtained by mathematical modeling propose that at least 320,000 types of viruses capable of infecting mammals may exist, most of which have not been described yet. Hence, monitoring circulation of the known viral pathogens, tracing down their spreading and changes in genome nucleotide sequence as well as revealing new types of viruses become important aspects of epidemiological surveillance necessary for timely response to emerging threats, prediction and early detection of outbreaks both in humans and animals. This review summarizes traditional molecular genetics methods for detection of viral pathogens, such as PCR, real-time PCR, Sanger sequencing with pre-cloning, and methods based on the second and third generation sequencing. Therefore, a more detailed overview was provided to diverse methods based on using such technologies because viral infectious agents investigated with high-throughput sequencing (or NGS — Next Generation Sequencing) has been increasingly appreciated as feasible for diagnostics, disease control, molecular epidemiology and infection control. Finally, a special attention was also paid to the approaches used to enrich the viral genetic material in samples containing low amount of pathogen nucleic acids.","Central Research Institute of Epidemiology; Center of Strategical Planning of the Ministry of Health; Central Research Institute of Epidemiology; Lomonosov Moscow State University; Central Research Institute of Epidemiology; Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology; Center of Strategical Planning of the Ministry of Health; St. Petersburg Pasteur Institute; Martsinovsky Institute of Medical Parasitology, Tropical and Vector-Borne Diseases",Infekciâ i Immunitet

Even though many etiological factors were reported, the specific mechanism of GR is yet to be elucidated. Given the species richness concerning marine biodiversity, it could be a treasure trove for drug discovery. In this study, we demonstrate the effects of a marine compound, (+)-rhodoptilometrin from crinoid, on gingival cell migration, wound healing, and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Experimental results showed that (+)-rhodoptilometrin can significantly increase wound healing, migration, and proliferation of human gingival fibroblast cells, and it does not have effects on oral mucosa fibroblast cells. In addition, (+)-rhodoptilometrin increases the gene and protein expression levels of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), fibronectin, and type I collagen, changes the intracellular distribution of FAK and F-actin, and increases OXPHOS and the expression levels of complexes I~V in the mitochondria. Based on our results, we believe that (+)-rhodoptilometrin might increase FAK expression and promote mitochondrial function to affect cell migration and promote gingival regeneration. Therefore, (+)-rhodoptilometrin may be a promising therapeutic agent for GR.","Department of Marine Biotechnology and Resources, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; Department of Marine Biotechnology and Resources, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; Department of Marine Biotechnology and Resources, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Marine Biology, National Dong Hwa University, Pingtung 944, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Marine Biology, National Dong Hwa University, Pingtung 944, Taiwan; Department of Marine Biotechnology and Resources, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Ping-Tung Christian Hospital, Pingtung 90059, Taiwan; Department of Marine Biotechnology and Resources, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; Center for Neuroscience, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; Department of Marine Biotechnology and Resources, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; Department of Marine Biotechnology and Resources, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; Department of Marine Biotechnology and Resources, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan",Marine Drugs

Recently, EGpresto, a highly viscous NBCA-based adhesive, has been developed for vascular-occlusion purposes. In this study, we investigated the heat of polymerization of EGpresto and compared the results with those of a low-viscosity NBCA glue. Results show that EGpresto exhibited a lower heat of polymerization (64 ± 7 °C vs. 34 ± 1 °C). This was due to its high viscosity, which resulted in a delayed polymerization time. To investigate the efficacy and safety of EGpresto for intravenous embolization, a 14 d in vivo animal test was conducted using three pigs. Five cc of EGpresto was injected into the epigastric vein of each animal. Complete postoperative vein occlusion was confirmed at 7 and 14 d by ultrasonographic visualization. After the animals were sacrificed, the operated and unoperated veins were exposed, and the injected adhesive was found without migration. During the histology, the injected adhesive was not found in the inner or outer vein walls, and the immune reactions seemed to be the only foreign-body reaction, showing that EGpresto is a non-toxic and safe intravascular embolic agent.","ENGAIN Co.

Adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) from 16 week old adult and 24 month old aging WKY rats were evaluated for the age-related changes in stem cell homeostasis. Effects of JS on self-renewal, klotho and Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase expression DNA damage response were determined by immunofluorescence staining. The effects were confirmed in senescence induced human ADMSCs and in addition, the potential of JS to maintain telomere length was evaluated by qPCR analysis in ADMSCs challenged for long term with doxorubicin. Further, the effects of JS on doxorubicin-induced hypertrophic effect and DNA damage in H9c2 cardiac cells; MPP+-induced damages in SH-SY5Y neuron cells were investigated. In addition, effects of JS in maintaining metabolic regulation, in terms of blood glucose regulation in type-II diabetes mice model, and their potential to suppress malignancy in different cancer cells were ascertained. The results show that JS maintains stem cell homeostasis and provides cytoprotection. In addition JS regulates blood glucose metabolism, enhances autophagic clearances in neurons and suppresses cancer growth and migration. The results show that JS acts on multiple targets and provides a cumulative protective effect against various age-associated disorders and therefore it is a candidate pleiotropic agent for healthy aging.","Cardiovascular and Mitochondrial Related Disease Research Center, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Hualien 970, Taiwan; Cardiovascular and Mitochondrial Related Disease Research Center, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Hualien 970, Taiwan; Cardiovascular and Mitochondrial Related Disease Research Center, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Hualien 970, Taiwan; Cardiovascular and Mitochondrial Related Disease Research Center, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Hualien 970, Taiwan; Cardiovascular and Mitochondrial Related Disease Research Center, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Hualien 970, Taiwan; Cardiovascular and Mitochondrial Related Disease Research Center, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Hualien 970, Taiwan; Cardiovascular and Mitochondrial Related Disease Research Center, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Hualien 970, Taiwan; Cardiovascular and Mitochondrial Related Disease Research Center, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Hualien 970, Taiwan; Buddhist Tzu Chi Charity Foundation, Hualien 970, Taiwan; Bioinnovation Center, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Hualien 970, Taiwan; Department of Neurosurgery, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Hualien 970, Taiwan; Department of Chinese Medicine, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Tzu Chi University, Hualien, Taiwan; Integration Center of Traditional Chinese and Modern Medicine, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Hualien 97002, Taiwan; School of Post‑Baccalaure‑ate Chinese Medicine, College of Medicine, Tzu Chi University, Hualien 97004, Taiwan; Buddhist Tzu Chi Foundation Hospital, Hualien 97002, Taiwan; Department of Biological Science and Technology, College of Life Sciences, China Medical University, Taichuang 406, Taiwan; Ph.D. Program for Biotechnology Industry, China Medical University, Taichuang 406, Taiwan; Correspondence to: Department of Biological Science and Technology, College of Life Sciences, China Medical University, Taichuang 406, Taiwan.; Cardiovascular and Mitochondrial Related Disease Research Center, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Hualien 970, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, China Medical University, Taichung 404, Taiwan; Department of Biological Science and Technology, Asia University, Taichung 413, Taiwan; Center of General Education, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Tzu Chi University of Science and Technology, Hualien 970, Taiwan; Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, China Medical University, Taichung 404, Taiwan; Correspondence to: Cardiovascular and Mitochondria Related Diseases Research Center, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Tzu Chi University of Science and Technology, Hualien 970, Taiwan.",Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy

In spite of the recent progress in targeted therapy, most LADC patients eventually expired due to the inevitable recurrence and drug resistance. New complementary agent with evidence-based molecular mechanism is urgently needed. MiR-34a is an important p53 downstream tumor suppressor, which regulates apoptosis, cell-cycle, EMT (epithelial mesenchymal transition), and so forth. Its expression is deficient in many types of cancers including LADC. Here, we show that a Chinese herbal formula JP-1 activates p53/miR-34a axis in A549 human LADC cells (p53 wild-type). Treatment with JP-1 induces p53 and its downstream p21 and BAX proteins as well as the miR-34a, resulting in growth inhibition, colony formation reduction, migration repression, and apoptosis induction. Accordingly, the decreases of miR-34a downstream targets such as CDK6, SIRT1, c-Myc, survivin, Snail, and AXL were observed. Moreover, JP-1 activates AMPKα and reduces mTOR activity, implying its inhibitory effect on the energy-sensitive protein synthesis and cell proliferation signaling. Our results show that JP-1 activates p53/miR-34a tumor suppressor axis and decreases proteins related to proliferation, apoptosis resistance, and metastasis, suggesting its potential as a complementary medicine for LADC treatment.","Cancer Center, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11696, Taiwan; Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11031, Taiwan; Cancer Center, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11696, Taiwan; Cancer Center, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11696, Taiwan; Cancer Center, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11696, Taiwan; Comprehensive Cancer Center of Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11031, Taiwan; Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11696, Taiwan; Cancer Center, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11696, Taiwan",Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine

Based on that knowledge, we decided to investigate the role of TYMS in the modulation of invasive ability in colon cancer cells, where its effect on cancer metastasis has not been studied in detail before. We employed colon cancer cells isolated from different stages of tumor development, cells undergoing EMT, and TYMS overexpressing cells. The elongation ratio, cell migration, invasion assay, and MMP-7 secretion were applied to analyze the cell behavior. Important epithelial and mesenchymal markers characteristic of EMT were examined at the protein level by Western blot assay. Overall, our study showed a correlation between TYMS level and invasion ability in colon cancer cells and, above all, a crucial role of TYMS in the EMT regulation. We postulate that chemotherapeutics that decrease or inhibit TYMS expression could increase the effectiveness of the therapy in patients with colon cancer, especially in the metastatic stage.","Department of Molecular Cell Mechanisms, Medical University of Lodz, Mazowiecka 6/8, 92-215 Lodz, Poland; Department of Structural Biology, Medical University of Lodz, Zeligowskiego 7/9, 90-752 Lodz, Poland; Department of Structural Biology, Medical University of Lodz, Zeligowskiego 7/9, 90-752 Lodz, Poland; Department of Molecular Cell Mechanisms, Medical University of Lodz, Mazowiecka 6/8, 92-215 Lodz, Poland",Biomedicines

However, cisplatin chemoresistance often occurs with the mechanisms being not well clarified, which results in the cancer recurrence and poor survival. Ginsenoside Rg3, isolated from the Chinese Herb Panax Ginseng, is recognized as an anti-cancer agent. Herein, we aimed to reveal whether Ginsenoside Rg3 alleviates cisplatin resistance and sensitizes GC cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis, and draw out the underlying molecular mechanism in cisplatin-resistant GC cells. The lower expression of miR-429 was found in AGSR-CDDP cells; it was also in association with cisplatin-resistance in GC cells and expression of which was restored following Ginsenoside Rg3 treatment. We also demonstrated that miR-429 made a contribution toward chemosensitivity in GC cells partly through SOX2 regulation. SOX2 was found to contribute to developing platinum resistance and was an authentic target for miR-429 in AGSR-CDDP cells. Importantly, enforced expression of SOX2 with a pcDNA3-SOX2 construct lacking the 3′-UTR miRNA binding site diminished the cytotoxic effects of miR-429 in AGSR-CDDP cells. We demonstrated that Ginsenoside Rg3 enhanced chemosensitivity in AGSR-CDDP GC cells, at least in part, through up-regulating miR-429, thereby targeting SOX2 and modulating downstream PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. Ginsenoside Rg3 was also found to regulate apoptosis-related genes via miR-429 in cisplatin-resistant GC cells. Ginsenoside Rg3 treatment significantly suppressed the migration rate of AGSR-CDDP GC cells, while following transfection with anti-miR-429, the anti-migratory effects of Ginsenoside Rg3 was partially abolished. This data suggested that Ginsenoside Rg3 may impede the chemoresistance and migration of GC cells mainly mediated through miR-429. We concluded that miR-429-regulated SOX2 expression was one of the main mechanisms by which Ginsenoside Rg3 dramatically promoted its anticancer effects on cisplatin-resistant GC cells. We also underscored a supporting model in which miR-429 adjusted PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling by regulating SOX2 in cisplatin-resistant GC cells.",NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN,Frontiers in Genetics

However, a comprehensive mechanobiological model to capture these spatiotemporal events and predict the growth and remodeling of an atherosclerotic artery is still lacking. Here, we present a multiscale model of leukocyte TEM and plaque evolution in the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. The approach integrates cellular behaviors via agent-based modeling (ABM) and hemodynamic effects via computational fluid dynamics (CFD). In this computational framework, the ABM implements the diffusion kinetics of key biological proteins, namely Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL), Tissue Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α), Interlukin-10 (IL-10) and Interlukin-1 beta (IL-1β), to predict chemotactic driven leukocyte migration into and within the artery wall. The ABM also considers wall shear stress (WSS) dependent leukocyte TEM and compensatory arterial remodeling obeying Glagov's phenomenon. Interestingly, using fully developed steady blood flow does not result in a representative number of leukocyte TEM as compared to pulsatile flow, whereas passing WSS at peak systole of the pulsatile flow waveform does. Moreover, using the model, we have found leukocyte TEM increases monotonically with decreases in luminal volume. At critical plaque shapes the WSS changes rapidly resulting in sudden increases in leukocyte TEM suggesting lumen volumes that will give rise to rapid plaque growth rates if left untreated. Overall this multi-scale and multi-physics approach appropriately captures and integrates the spatiotemporal events occurring at the cellular level in order to predict leukocyte transmigration and plaque evolution.",NaN; NaN,PLoS Computational Biology

On the other hand resistivity of concrete against chloride penetration can be improved by careful selection of concrete constituents and production. Detailed results of two series of extensive experimental studies are presented herein. Chloride ion binding capacity of tested cements in decreasing sequence was the following: (1) CEM III/B 32,5 N-S; (2) CEM III/A 32,5 N; (3) CEM II/B 32,5 R; (4) CEM II/B-M (V-L) 32,5 R; (5) CEM I 42,5 N.

Instead of sending the data gathered by each node to the sink as in client/server, MAs migrate to the sensor nodes (SNs) to collect data, thus reducing energy consumption and bandwidth usage. For MAs, to migrate among SNs, an itinerary should be planned before the migration. Many approaches have been proposed to solve the problem of itinerary planning for MAs, but all of these approaches are based on the assumption that MAs visit all SNs. This assumption, however, is inefficient because of the increasing size of the MAs after visiting each node. Also, in case of node(s) failure, as it is often the case in WSNs, the MAs may not be able to migrate among SNs. None of the proposed approaches takes into consideration the problem of fault tolerance. In this paper, we propose multi-mobile agent itinerary planning-based energy and fault aware data aggregation in wireless sensor networks (MAEF) to plan itineraries for MAs. This can be achieved by grouping nodes in clusters and planning itineraries efficiently among cluster heads (CHs) only. What is more, an alternative itinerary is planned in case of node(s) failure. The simulation result clearly shows that our novel approach performs better than the existing ones.","Computer Science Department, Science Faculty, Chouaib Doukkali University; Computer Science Department, Science Faculty, Chouaib Doukkali University; Mathematics and Computer Science Department, National School of Applied Sciences, Hassan 1st Universit",EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking

Casiope'inas have demonstrated a cytotoxic effect by activation of pro-apoptotic processes in malignant cells. Such processes have been proved to activate the apoptotic intrinsic route, as well as cell cycle arrest. Despite this knowledge, the whole mechanism of action of Casiope'inas is yet to be completely understood. In this work, we implement a systems biology approach based on two pathway analysis tools (Over-Representation Analysis and Causal Network Analysis), to observe changes in some hallmarks of cancer, induced  by this copper-based chemotherapeutic agent in HeLa cell lines. We find that the metabolism of metal ions is exacerbated, as well as cell division processes being globally diminished. We also show that cellular migration and proliferation events are decreased. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms of liver protection are increased in the cell cultures under the actions of Casiope'inas, unlike the case in many other cytotoxic drugs. We argue that this chemotherapeutic agent may be promising, given its protective hepatic function, concomitant with its cytotoxic participation in the onset of apoptotic processes in malignant cells.",National Institute of Genomic Medicine; Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México; National Institute of Genomic Medicine; Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México; Universidad Autónoma de Querétaro; Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México,Frontiers in Physiology

It suppresses TNF-α and other inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, upregulates anti-inflammatory IL-10, and promotes immune tolerant cells called T regulatory (Treg) cells. VIP KO mice have recently been demonstrated to have spontaneous airway and pulmonary perivascular inflammatory responses, as part of asthma-like and pulmonary hypertension phenotypes, respectively. Both inflammatory responses are correctable with VIP. Focusing on this model, we have now investigated the influence of VIP not only on inflammatory cells but also on Treg cells.</p> <p>Methods</p> <p>Using flow cytometric analysis, we examined the relative preponderance of CD25+CD4+ cells and anti-inflammatory Treg cells, in extracts of thymus and spleen from VIP KO mice (5 VIP KO; 5 VIP KO+ VIP; 10 wild-type).

Hst has been shown to possess bioactivity as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, hypolipidemic, vasoprotector, and anticancer agent. This study aimed to identify potential combinations of Hst and the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin (Dox) as co-chemotherapy agents against 4T1 murine metastatic breast cancer cells. Results MTT assay results showed that Hst exhibited cytotoxic effect in 4T1 cells, and its combination with Dox showed a synergistic effect based on the CI value. The combination of Hst and Dox increased G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction. The combination of Hst and Dox inhibited migration and decreased MMP-9 expression in 4T1 cells. Conclusion In conclusion, the results of this study show that Hst has potential as a Dox co-chemotherapy against 4T1 cells by inducing G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. More importantly, Hst reduces Dox-induced migration and decreases MMP-9 expression.","Akademi Farmasi Indonesia Yogyakarta; Cancer Chemoprevention Research Center, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitas Gadjah Mada; Cancer Chemoprevention Research Center, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitas Gadjah Mada; Cancer Chemoprevention Research Center, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitas Gadjah Mada; Cancer Chemoprevention Research Center, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitas Gadjah Mada",Future Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences

Inhibiting constitutive STAT3 signaling represents a potential therapeutic approach. We used structure-based design to develop a nonpeptide, cell-permeable, small molecule, termed as LLL12, which targets STAT3. LLL12 was found to inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation (tyrosine 705) and induce apoptosis as indicated by the increases of cleaved caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase in various breast, pancreatic, and glioblastoma cancer cell lines expressing elevated levels of STAT3 phosphorylation. LLL12 could also inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation induced by interleukin-6 in MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells. The inhibition of STAT3 by LLL12 was confirmed by the inhibition of STAT3 DNA binding activity and STAT3-dependent transcriptional luciferase activity. Downstream targets of STAT3, cyclin D1, Bcl-2, and survivin were also downregulated by LLL12 at both protein and messenger RNA levels. LLL12 is a potent inhibitor of cell viability, with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations values ranging between 0.16 and 3.09 µM, which are lower than the reported JAK2 inhibitor WP1066 and STAT3 inhibitor S3I-201 in six cancer cell lines expressing elevated levels of STAT3 phosphorylation. In addition, LLL12 inhibits colony formation and cell migration and works synergistically with doxorubicin and gemcitabine. Furthermore, LLL12 demonstrated a potent inhibitory activity on breast and glioblastoma tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. Our results indicate that LLL12 may be a potential therapeutic agent for human cancer cells expressing constitutive STAT3 signaling.","Center for Childhood Cancer, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Columbus, OH, USA; Center for Childhood Cancer, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Columbus, OH, USA; Division of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA; Center for Childhood Cancer, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Columbus, OH, USA; Center for Childhood Cancer, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Columbus, OH, USA; Center for Childhood Cancer, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Columbus, OH, USA; Center for Childhood Cancer, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Columbus, OH, USA; Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology Program, Columbus, OH, USA; Center for Childhood Cancer, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Columbus, OH, USA; Division of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA; Center for Childhood Cancer, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Columbus, OH, USA; Division of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA; Center for Childhood Cancer, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Columbus, OH, USA",Neoplasia: An International Journal for Oncology Research

Current treatment strategies aimed at treating the consequences of coronary artery disease have embraced both optimal medical therapy and catheter based percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents (DES). Current-generation DES elute predominantly mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, which act primarily as a cytostatic agent that retards vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration; this occurs in response to injury and thus prevents restenosis. While DES have reduced restenosis, the use of first-generation DES was associated with an increased risk of late stent thrombosis and accelerated neointimal atherosclerosis (i.e. neoatherosclerosis), both major contributors to late stent failure. The underlying substrate of late DES failure is likely related to vascular endothelial dysfunction, which occurs after DES implantation. Initial concerns with first-generation DES have led to improvements in stent design, polymer load and biocompatibility, and pharmacologic agents, all of which have helped to improve healing responses, lessen late stent failure, and result in an overall improved safety profile. The armamentarium of DES has expanded from the current-generation durable polymer DES to bioresorbable polymer DES, polymer-free DES, and lastly totally bioresorbable vascular scaffolds with a goal of improving vascular responses and endothelial function while preserving anti-restenotic efficacy. We will review these contemporary DES in relation to their short and long-term effects on vascular biocompatibility and healing responses.","Parkview Heart Institute, Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA; CVPath Institute Inc., Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA; CVPath Institute Inc., Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA; CVPath Institute Inc., Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA; University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA",European Medical Journal

Abstracted cellular functions and melanocyte-matrix interactions are modeled as stochastic events. For identification and validation we use visual renderings of simulated cell populations in a horizontal perspective that reproduce growth patterns observed in vivo by sequential dermatoscopy and corresponding vertical views that reproduce the arrangement of melanocytes observed in histopathologic sections. Our results show that a balanced interplay of proliferation and migration produces the typical reticular pattern of nevi, whereas the globular pattern involves additional cellular mechanisms. We further demonstrate that slight variations in the three basic cellular properties proliferation, migration, and adhesion are sufficient to produce a large variety of morphological appearances of nevi. We anticipate our model to be a starting point for the reproduction of more complex scenarios that will help to establish functional connections between abstracted microscopic behavior and macroscopic patterns in all types of melanocytic proliferations including melanoma.",NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN,PLoS Computational Biology

These new blood vessels allow tumors to continue to grow beyond what the pre-existing vasculature could support. Here, we construct a mathematical model to simulate tumor angiogenesis by considering each endothelial cell as an agent, and allowing the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nutrient fields to impact the dynamics and phenotypic transitions of each tumor and endothelial cell. The phenotypes of the endothelial cells (i.e., tip, stalk, and phalanx cells) are selected by the local VEGF field, and govern the migration and growth of vessel sprouts at the cellular level. Over time, these vessels grow and migrate to the tumor, forming anastomotic loops to supply nutrients, while interacting with the tumor through mechanical forces and the consumption of VEGF. The model is able to capture collapsing and breaking of vessels caused by tumor-endothelial cell interactions. This is accomplished through modeling the physical interaction between the vasculature and the tumor, resulting in vessel occlusion and tumor heterogeneity over time due to the stages of response in angiogenesis. Key parameters are identified through a sensitivity analysis based on the Sobol method, establishing which parameters should be the focus of subsequent experimental efforts. During the avascular phase (i.e., before angiogenesis is triggered), the nutrient consumption rate, followed by the rate of nutrient diffusion, yield the greatest influence on the number and distribution of tumor cells. Similarly, the consumption and diffusion of VEGF yield the greatest influence on the endothelial and tumor cell numbers during angiogenesis. In summary, we present a hybrid mathematical approach that characterizes vascular changes via an agent-based model, while treating nutrient and VEGF changes through a continuum model. The model describes the physical interaction between a tumor and the surrounding blood vessels, explicitly allowing the forces of the growing tumor to influence the nutrient delivery of the vasculature.",NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN,PLoS ONE

However, the underlying mechanism for AGGF1-mediated therapeutic angiogenesis is unknown. Here, we show for the first time that AGGF1 activates autophagy, a housekeeping catabolic cellular process, in endothelial cells (ECs), HL1, H9C2, and vascular smooth muscle cells. Studies with Atg5 small interfering RNA (siRNA) and the autophagy inhibitors bafilomycin A1 (Baf) and chloroquine demonstrate that autophagy is required for AGGF1-mediated EC proliferation, migration, capillary tube formation, and aortic ring-based angiogenesis. Aggf1+/- knockout (KO) mice show reduced autophagy, which was associated with inhibition of angiogenesis, larger infarct areas, and contractile dysfunction after MI. Protein therapy with AGGF1 leads to robust recovery of myocardial function and contraction with increased survival, increased ejection fraction, reduction of infarct areas, and inhibition of cardiac apoptosis and fibrosis by promoting therapeutic angiogenesis in mice with MI. Inhibition of autophagy in mice by bafilomycin A1 or in Becn1+/- and Atg5 KO mice eliminates AGGF1-mediated angiogenesis and therapeutic actions, indicating that autophagy acts upstream of and is essential for angiogenesis. Mechanistically, AGGF1 initiates autophagy by activating JNK, which leads to activation of Vps34 lipid kinase and the assembly of Becn1-Vps34-Atg14 complex involved in the initiation of autophagy. Our data demonstrate that (1) autophagy is essential for effective therapeutic angiogenesis to treat CAD and MI; (2) AGGF1 is critical to induction of autophagy; and (3) AGGF1 is a novel agent for treatment of CAD and MI.

However, the response to chemotherapy is absolutely unsatisfactory and the prognosis of pancreatic cancer remains very poor. Therefore, it would be greatly beneficial to develop therapeutic approaches that cause pancreatic cancer cells to increase their sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine. Forskolin is a natural cAMP elevating agent used for centuries in traditional medicine and its safety has been also documented in modern medicine. Notably, forskolin is emerging as a very interesting molecule to possibly use in cancer therapy. In the present study, we investigated the effects of forskolin on the proliferation, migration and sensitivity to gemcitabine of pancreatic cancer cells, carrying out flow cytometry-based assays of cell-cycle progression and cell death, wound-healing and MTT assays, direct cell number counting and immunoblotting experiments. Here, we show that forskolin exerts significant growth and migratory inhibitory effects on Panc-1 and AsPC-1 pancreatic cancer cells. In addition, we report that forskolin strongly enhances gemcitabine-induced antiproliferative effects by both cell cycle inhibition and cell death induction. Importantly, the forskolin-induced potentiation of antiproliferative effect by gemcitabine is preceded and accompanied by a strong inhibition of phosphorylation levels of Stat3 and Erk1/2 proteins.

Several studies have demonstrated their plethora of biological activities—including anti-cancer activity—in a number of cell lines. <i>Anisosciadium lanatum</i> Boiss. is a perennial aromatic herb. Traditionally, it is an edible safe herb with few studies exploring its importance. The current study aims to investigate the chemical composition of essential oil isolated from <i>Anisosciadium lanatum</i> using GC-MS, as well as report its anti-cancer potential and its mechanistic effect on HepG2 liver cancer cell lines, and conduct molecular docking studies. To achieve this, the essential oil was isolated using a Clevenger apparatus and analyzed using GC-MS. The cell viability of HepG2 liver cancer and normal fibroblast NIH-3T3 cell lines was assessed by MTT cytotoxicity assay. The effects of the essential oil on cell migration and invasion were assessed using wound healing and matrigel assays, respectively. The effect of the essential oil on migration and apoptotic-regulating mRNA and proteins was quantified using quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot techniques, respectively. Finally, computational docking tools were used to analyze in silico binding of major constituents from the essential oil against apoptotic and migration markers. A total of 38 components were identified and quantified. The essential oil demonstrated regulation of cell proliferation and cell viability in HepG2 liver cancer cells at a sub-lethal dose of 10 to 25 μg/mL, and expressed reductions of migration and invasion. The treatment with essential oil indicated mitigation of cancer activity by aborting the mRNA of pro-apoptotic markers such as BCL-2, CASPASE-3, CYP-1A1, and NFκB. The algorithm-based binding studies demonstrated that eucalyptol, nerol, camphor, and linalool have potent binding towards the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2. On the other hand, camphor and eucalyptol showed potent binding towards the pro-apoptotic protein CASPASE-3. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the essential oil isolated from <i>Anisosciadium lanatum</i> to drive alleviation of HepG2 cancer cell progression by modulating apoptotic markers. Our findings suggest that <i>Anisosciadium lanatum</i> could be used as a phytotherapeutic anti-cancer agent, acting through the regulation of apoptotic markers.

Analysis of the TMZ resistant (TMZres) variants in conjunction with their parental, sensitive cell lines shows that acquisition of TMZ resistance is accompanied by broad phenotypic changes, including increased proliferation, migration, chromosomal aberrations, and secretion of cytosolic lipids. Importantly, each TMZ resistant model captures a different facet of the “go” (8MGBA-TMZres) or “grow” (42MGBA-TMZres) hypothesis of GBM behavior.

Annexin A1 (AnxA1), a glucocorticoid-regulated protein, is effective at inhibiting neutrophil transendothelial migration by binding the formyl peptide receptors (FPRs). We aimed to investigate whether 2ME upregulates the expression of AnxA1 and protects against IR-induced lung damage.Methods: IR-mediated acute lung inflammation was induced by ischemia for 40 min followed by reperfusion for 60 min in an isolated, perfused rat lung model. The rat lungs were randomly treated with vehicle or 2ME, and the functional relevance of AnxA1 was determined using an anti-AnxA1 antibody or BOC2 (a pan-receptor antagonist of the FPR). In vitro, human primary alveolar epithelial cells (HPAECs) and rat neutrophils were pretreated with 2ME and an AnxA1 siRNA or anti-AnxA1 antibody and subjected to hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR).Results: 2ME significantly decreased all lung edema parameters, neutrophil infiltration, oxidative stress, proinflammatory cytokine production, lung cell apoptosis, tight junction protein disruption, and lung tissue injury in the IR-induced acute lung inflammation model. 2ME also increased the expression of the AnxA1 mRNA and protein and suppressed the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). In vitro, 2ME attenuated HR-triggered NF-κB activation and interleukin-8 production in HPAECs, decreased transendothelial migration, tumor necrosis factor-α production, and increased apoptosis in neutrophils exposed to HR. These protective effects of 2ME were significantly abrogated by BOC2, the anti-AnxA1 antibody, or AnxA1 siRNA.Conclusions: 2ME ameliorates IR-induced acute lung inflammation by increasing AnxA1 expression.

Afterward, the cells were stimulated by LPS (Lipopolysaccharide) and MMPs (Matrix Metalloproteinase) expression level in the BFLS cells were investigated using Real-Time PCR, in vitro Migration and Gelatin Zymography, Western Blot Analysis, ELISA Assay and Invasion Assay.
Results: The results showed that PA significantly decreased MMP-9 expression levels in LPS-stimulated BFLS cells; also, it suppressed migration and invasion of the mentioned cells. However, PA had no significant effect on MMP-1-2-3.
Conclusion: Based on our results PA could significantly reduce the activity and inflammatory effect of MMP-9 in OA, its potential role as a supplementary agent to common NSAIDs and corticosteroids was confirmed. Nonetheless, cellular modeling does not significantly confirm the beneficial effect of OA in patients.","

Human lymphocytes were exposed to different concentrations of Methyl Methane Sulfonate (MMS), Maleic Hydrazide (MH), 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic (2,4-D), and N-nitroso diethylamine (NDEA). Using comet assay, the migration means of the comets were determined and later grouped arbitrarily in migration groups with no higher differences than 1 µc. The number of migration groups, the number of comets in each group, and the groups with the highest number of comets (modes) were determined. All four of the genotoxic agents studied showed a significant increase (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in the tail length and the number of migration groups compared to the negative control. The number of migration groups did not show a significant variation between the four-genotoxic agents nor within their different concentrations. However, the comparison of the modes did show differences between the genotoxic agents, but not within the concentrations of a same genotoxic agent, which indicated a determined chemical interaction on the DNA. These parameters can improve the detection of genetic damage associated with certain genotoxic agents.","Environmental Mutagenesis Laboratory, Cellular and Molecular Department, University of Guadalajara, Jalisco C.P. 45200, Mexico; Environmental Mutagenesis Laboratory, Cellular and Molecular Department, University of Guadalajara, Jalisco C.P. 45200, Mexico; Environmental Mutagenesis Laboratory, Cellular and Molecular Department, University of Guadalajara, Jalisco C.P. 45200, Mexico; Environmental Mutagenesis Laboratory, Cellular and Molecular Department, University of Guadalajara, Jalisco C.P. 45200, Mexico; Environmental Mutagenesis Laboratory, Cellular and Molecular Department, University of Guadalajara, Jalisco C.P. 45200, Mexico; Mastitis and Molecular Diagnostic, Internal Medicine Department, CUCBA University of Guadalajara, Jalisco C.P. 45200, Mexico; Biotechnology Laboratory, Department of Botany and Zoology, University Centre for Biological and Agricultural Sciences, Guadalajara University, Guadalajara, Jalisco C.P. 45200, Mexico",Applied Sciences

A Fast Screening Tool to De-Risk Hydrocarbon Prospects,2022,"Understanding subsurface hydrocarbon migration is a crucial task for petroleum geoscientists. Hydrocarbons are released from deeply buried and heated source rocks, such as shales with a high organic content. They then migrate upwards through the overlying lithologies. Some hydrocarbon becomes trapped in suitable geological structures that, over a geological timescale, produce viable hydrocarbon reservoirs. This work investigates how intelligent agent models can mimic these complex natural subsurface processes and account for geological uncertainty. Physics-based approaches are commonly used in petroleum system modelling and flow simulation software to identify migration pathways from source rocks to traps. However, the problem with these simulations is that they are computationally demanding, making them infeasible for extensive uncertainty quantification. In this work, we present a novel dynamic screening tool for secondary hydrocarbon migration that relies on agent-based modelling. It is fast and is therefore suitable for uncertainty quantification, before using petroleum system modelling software for a more accurate evaluation of migration scenarios. We first illustrate how interacting but independent agents can mimic the movement of hydrocarbon molecules using a few simple rules by focusing on the main drivers of migration: buoyancy and capillary forces. Then, using a synthetic case study, we validate the usefulness of the agent modelling approach to quantify the impact of geological parameter uncertainty (e.g., fault transmissibility, source rock location, expulsion rate) on potential hydrocarbon accumulations and migrations pathways, an essential task to enable quick de-risking of a likely prospect.","Institute of GeoEnergy Engineering (IGE), Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, UK; Institute of GeoEnergy Engineering (IGE), Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, UK; Studio X LLC, Austin, TX 78702, USA; Studio X LLC, Austin, TX 78702, USA; Institute of GeoEnergy Engineering (IGE), Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, UK; Institute of GeoEnergy Engineering (IGE), Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, UK",Energies

The intelligent nanocapsule is a new way to embed surfactant into polymer, which has the advantage of avoiding invalid loss of surfactant in the capsule. In this paper, nanoscale silicon dioxide was prepared by sol–gel method, Janus silica nanoparticles were synthesized by Pickering emulsion preparation, and a Janus functional particle with targeted migration was obtained by coupling agent modification. The amphiphilic temperature responsive polymer AP-g-PNIPAAM was synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization. The capsule wall prepared in this paper has temperature sensitivity, and Janus functional particles in the core play a targeted role. The oil displacement experiments were carried out on five parallel core models with different grade differences. The results show that when the permeability grade of the parallel combined model rises from 2.05 to 21.57, the oil recovery of Janus intelligent microcapsule dispersion system also increases from 11.16% to 20.75%, with an increase rate of 9.59%.

However, treatment with cisplatin is associated with drug resistance and several adverse side effects such as nephrotoxicity, reduced immunity towards infections and hearing loss. A Combination of cisplatin with other drugs is an approach to overcome drug resistance and reduce toxicity. The combination therapy also results in increased sensitivity of cisplatin towards cancer cells. The mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in the cell, consisting of extracellular signal regulated kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38 kinases, and downstream mediator p90 ribosomal s6 kinase (RSK); is responsible for the regulation of various cellular events including cell survival, cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, cell migration and protein translation. This review article demonstrates the role of MAPK pathway in cisplatin based therapy, illustrates different combination therapy involving cisplatin and also shows the importance of targeting MAPK family, particularly RSK, to achieve increased anticancer effect and overcome drug resistance when combined with cisplatin.","Translational Research Institute, Hamad Medical Corporation; College of Pharmacy, Qatar University; College of Pharmacy, Qatar University; College of Pharmacy, Qatar University; Translational Research Institute, Hamad Medical Corporation; College of Pharmacy, Qatar University",Journal of Translational Medicine

It was recently reported that fucoidan also exerts an antitumor function. Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. The aim of this study was to investigate anti-tumor,apoptosis and anti-metastasis effects of fucoidan in both cell-based assays and mouse xenograft model, as well as to clarify possible role of m-TOR pathway in the protection. Methods In vitro: Different concentrations of fucoidan were given to act on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines A549 and H1650. The effects of fucoidan on cell proliferation were observed by detecting cyclin expression levels, CCK8 and EDU experiments and cloning experiments. The apoptotic level was detected by flow cytometry and the apoptotic protein level was detected by Westernblot. By detecting the expression of adhesion molecules, the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family, and Transwell cell invasion and migration experiment, the effect of fucoidan on cell adhesion, invasion and migration was observed. Meanwhile the effect of fucoidan on angiogenesis was observed by detecting the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In vivo experiment: An animal model of NSCLC cell mouse subcutaneous xenograft tumor was established to analyze the correlation between the consumption of fucoidan and the size and volume of xenograft tumor through gross observation. Through immunohistochemical staining and immunofluorescence double staining, ki67 and cell adhesion molecules (E-cadherin, N-cadherin and CD31) and VEGF-A in the tumor were detected, and the correlation between the amount of fucoidan and the above indexes was analyzed. Results Fucoidan inhibited the proliferation and angiogenesis of NSCLC cells via the mTOR pathway and promoted their apoptosis by increasing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Not only that, fucoidan inhibited NSCLC cell invasion via epithelial–mesenchymal transformation (EMT). The mice fed fucoidan exhibited significant reductions in tumor volumes and weights. These indicators (Ki67, VEGF-A,N-cadherin) were decreased and E-cadherin expression was up-regulated in A549 mice that treated with fucoidan. The results showed that fucoidan inhibited tumor proliferation in vivo by affecting the expression of related proteins. Conclusion Fucoidan conveys antitumor effects and our results represent an ideal therapeutic agent for NSCLC.","Department of Oncology, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University; Department of Oncology, Heze Municipal Hospital; Department of Oncology, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University; Department of Oncology, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University; Department of Oncology, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University; State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Seaweed Substances; State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Seaweed Substances",BMC Complementary Medicine and Therapies

CXCR4 binds to its ligand SDF-1 to make an axis involved in the homing property of stem cells. This study aimed to employ WHIM syndrome pathogenesis as an inspirational approach to reinforce cell therapies. Wild type and WHIM-type variants of the CXCR4 gene were chemically synthesized and cloned in the pCDH-513B-1 lentiviral vector. Molecular cloning of the synthetic genes was confirmed by DNA sequencing, and expression of both types of CXCR4 at the protein level was confirmed by western blotting in HEK293T cells. Human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (Ad-MSCs) were isolated, characterized, and subjected to lentiviral transduction with Wild type and WHIM-type variants of CXCR4 . The presence of copGFP-positive MSCs confirmed the high efficiency of transduction. The migration ability of both groups of transduced cells was then assessed by transwell migration assay in the presence or absence of a CXCR4-blocking agent. Our qRT-PCR results showed overexpression of CXCR4 at mRNA level in both groups of transduced MSCs, and expression of WHIM-type CXCR4 was significantly higher than Wild type CXCR4 ( P <0.05). Our results indicated that the migration of genetically modified MSCs expressing WHIM-type CXCR4 had significantly enhanced towards SDF1 in comparison with Wild type CXCR4 ( P <0.05), while it was reduced after treatment with CXCR4 antagonist. These data suggest that overexpression of WHIM-type CXCR4 could lead to enhanced and sustained expression of CXCR4 on human MSCs, which would increase their homing capability; hence it might be an appropriate strategy to improve the efficiency of cell-based therapies.","

Experiments targeting single tube structure with thalidomide, followed by nitric oxide treatment, show that the tube structures are insensitive to thalidomide and nitric oxide.

Chlorogenic acid (CGA), a polyphenol, has several biological activities, including the suppression of liver cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Increased levels or alterations in the function of DNMT1 are associated with the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. However, the CGA-affected DNMT1 expression mediated mechanism is still unclear.MethodsThe human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) HepG2 cells were treated with a positive control drug (5-AZA) or varying doses of CGA. DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) protein levels and other relevant proteins were evaluated using Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Cell-cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry-based PI staining, and cell viability was assessed using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The transwell invasion and wound healing assays were used to evaluate cell migration and invasion. In vivo proliferation of the HCC cells was detected. We investigated the expression of DNMT1, p53, p21, p-ERK, MMP-2, and MMP-9 in tumors using immunohistochemical analysis.ResultsOur results showed that CGA inhibited the proliferation, colony formation, invasion, and metastasis of HepG2 cells both in vitro and in vivo by down-regulating DNMT1 protein expression, which enhanced p53 and p21 activity, and resulting in a significant reduction in cell proliferation and metastasis. Moreover, CGA inactivated ERK1/2 and reduced MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in HepG2 cells.ConclusionsCGA can suppress liver cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis through several pathways. CGA could serve as a candidate chemopreventive agent for HCC.","Center of Integrative Medicine, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China; Center of Integrative Medicine, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China; Center of Integrative Medicine, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China; Center of Integrative Medicine, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China; Center of Integrative Medicine, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China; Department of Gastroenterology, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China; Department of Gastroenterology, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China; Center of Integrative Medicine, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China; Department of Gastroenterology, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China; Center of Integrative Medicine, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China; Center of Integrative Medicine, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China",Frontiers in Pharmacology

The expediency of using ABM as a development planning tool areas, including strategic, is shown. A territory-population model developed by the authors is based on the behavior of individual members of artificial society and simulates the processes of mortality, fertility and migration. The creation of new agents (birth of children) in the model is the result of the choice of female agents of reproductive age, and this choice depends on their value system. At the same time the population of agents in this regard is not uniform - agents stick to different reproductive strategies: modern (low fertility), and traditional (high fertility). The migration of agents depends on the difference in the level of per capita income both between different areas within a country and between countries.

The traditional view of salivary glands as accessory digestive structures is changing as their importance as sources of systemically active immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory factors is recognized.

The potent anti-inflammatory activities, both <it>in vivo </it>and <it>in vitro</it>, of the tripeptide Phe-Glu-Gly (FEG) are reviewed. FEG is a carboxyl terminal peptide of the prohormone SMR1 identified in the rat submandibular salivary gland, The D-isomeric form (feG) mimics the activity of its L-isomer FEG. Macropharmacologically, feG attenuates the cardiovascular and inflammatory effects of endotoxemia and anaphylaxis, by inhibition of hypotension, leukocyte migration, vascular leak, and disruption of pulmonary function and intestinal motility. Mechanistically, feG affects activated inflammatory cells, especially neutrophils, by regulating integrins and inhibiting intracellular production of reactive oxygen species. Pharmacodynamically, feG is active at low doses (100 μg/kg) and has a long (9-12 hour) biological half life. As a therapeutic agent, feG shows promise in diseases characterized by over exuberant inflammatory responses such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome and other acute inflammatory diseases. Arthritis, sepsis, acute pancreatitis, asthma, acute respiratory inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease, and equine laminitis are potential targets for this promising therapeutic peptide.

However, the lack of control over cell behavior represents a major concern regarding the efficacy and the safety of the therapy. Here, we demonstrated that when formulating the biosystem, an adequate selection of osmolarity adjusting agents significantly contributes to the regulation of cell responses. Our data showed that these agents interact in the capsule formation process, influencing the alginate crosslinking degree. Therefore, when selecting inert or electrolyte-based osmolarity adjusting agents to encapsulate D1 multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), alginate microcapsules with differing mechanical properties were obtained. Since mechanical forces acting on cells influence their behavior, contrasting cell responses were observed both, in vitro and in vivo. When employing mannitol as an inert osmolarity adjusting agent, microcapsules presented a more permissive matrix, allowing a tumoral-like behavior. This resulted in the formation of enormous cell-aggregates that presented necrotic cores and protruding peripheral cells, rendering the therapy unpredictable, dysfunctional, and unsafe. Conversely, the use of electrolyte osmolarity adjusting agents, including calcium or sodium, provided the capsule with a suitable crosslinking degree that established a tight control over cell proliferation and enabled an adequate therapeutic regimen in vivo. The crucial impact of these agents was confirmed when gene expression studies reported pivotal divergences not only in proliferative pathways, but also in genes involved in survival, migration, and differentiation. Altogether, our results prove osmolarity adjusting agents as an effective tool to regulate cell behavior and obtain safer and more predictable therapies.","University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain; Fungal and Bacterial Biomics Research Group, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU); INIBIC Institute for Biomedical research; University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain; University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain; University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain; University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain",Drug Delivery

By presenting a spatio-temporal model of the mammalian female genital tract combined with agent-based description of sperm motion and interaction as well as parameterizing it with bovine data, we offer an alternative possibility for studying sperm migration in silico. The model incorporates genital tract geometry as well as biophysical principles of sperm motion observed in vitro such as positive rheotaxis and thigmotaxis. This model for sperm migration from vagina to oviducts was successfully tested against in vivo data from literature. We found that physical sperm characteristics such as velocity and directional stability as well as sperm-fluid interactions and wall alignment are critical for success, i.e. sperms reaching the oviducts. Therefore, we propose that these identified sperm parameters should be considered in detail for conditioning sperm in artificial selection procedures since the natural processes are normally bypassed in reproductive in vitro technologies.

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)1 signaling has been proposed as a mechanism of PTX resistance, but it is unclear whether this can be overcome by FGFR1 inhibition. The present study investigated whether FGFR1 overexpression contributes to PTX resistance and whether FGFR inhibition can enhance PTX efficacy in UC. The effects of PTX combined with the FGFR inhibitor BGJ398 were evaluated in UC cell lines by flow cytometry; Western blot analysis; cell viability, migration, and colony forming assays; and RNA interference. PTX+BGJ398 induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in UC cells with mesenchymal characteristics was accompanied by downregulation of cyclin D1 protein and upregulation of gamma-histone 2A family member X and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Additionally, PTX+BGJ398 synergistically suppressed UC cell migration and colony formation via regulation of EMT-associated factors, while FGFR1 knockdown enhanced the antitumor effect of PTX. These findings provide a basis for development of effective strategies for overcoming PTX resistance in UC through inhibition of FGFR1 signaling.","Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seongnam 13620, Korea; Medical Research Collaborating Center, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam 13605, Korea; Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seongnam 13620, Korea; Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seongnam 13620, Korea; Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seongnam 13620, Korea; Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seongnam 13620, Korea; Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seongnam 13620, Korea; Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seongnam 13620, Korea; Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seongnam 13620, Korea; Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seongnam 13620, Korea; Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seongnam 13620, Korea; Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seongnam 13620, Korea; Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seongnam 13620, Korea; Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul 03722, Korea; Medical Research Collaborating Center, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam 13605, Korea; Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul 03722, Korea",International Journal of Molecular Sciences

In this research we use an agent-based model of human mobility and interaction, based on ethnographic and archaeological data, to explore the impact of ecological risk on human population structure via a reconstructed landscape of habitat suitability. The agent-based model allows us to evaluate the size and location of glacial refugia, the size of the populations occupying them and the degree of genetic relatedness between people occupying these areas. To do this, we model the probability of an agent foraging groups' survival as a function of habitat suitability. The model's simulated ""genomes"" (composed of regionally specific genetic markers) allow us to track long-term trends of inter-regional interaction and mobility. The results agree with previous archaeological studies situating a large glacial refugium spanning southern France and northeastern Spain, but we expand on those studies by demonstrating that higher rates of population growth in this central refugium led to continuous out-migration and therefore genetic homogeneity across Western Europe, with the possible exception of the Italian peninsula.

Liver cirrhosis and cancer are a consequence of the abnormal angio-architecture formation of liver and formation of new blood vessels. This angiogenesis is driven by overexpression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (Hif1-α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Apart from this, protein kinase B (Akt) is also impaired in liver cancer. Despite the advancement in conventional treatments, liver cancer remains largely incurable. Nowadays, the use of naturally occurring anticancer agents particularly flavonoids is subject to more attention due to their enhanced physicochemical properties. Therefore, this study underlines the use of a natural anticancer agent taxifolin in the treatment of liver cancer using hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 and Huh7. The aim of our study is to devise a natural and efficient solution for the disease prevalent in Pakistan. The study involved the assessment of binding of ligand taxifolin using molecular docking. The binding of taxifolin with the proteins (Hif1-α, VEGF and Akt) was calculated by docking using Vina and Chimera. Further evaluation was performed by cell viability assay (MTT 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) Assay), colony formation assay, cell migration assay, DNA ladder assay and flow cytometry. To see whether taxifolin directly affected expression levels, analysis of gene expression of Hif1-α, VEGF and Akt was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blotting. In silico docking experiments revealed that these proteins showed favorable docking scores with taxifolin. Treatment with taxifolin resulted in the inhibition of the liver cancer growth and migration, and induced apoptosis in HepG2 and Huh7 cell lines at an inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 0.15 µM and 0.22 µM, respectively. The expression of HIF1-α, VEGF and Akt was significantly reduced in a dose- dependent manner. The inhibitory effect of taxifolin on hepatic cells suggested its chemopreventive and therapeutic potential. The studied compound taxifolin exhibited pronounced pro-apoptotic and hepatoprotective potential. Our study has confirmed the pro-apoptotic potential of taxifolin in liver cancer cell lines and will pave a way to the use of taxifolin as a chemotherapeutic agent after its further validation on the animal models and humans based epidemiological studies.","Atta-Ur-Rahman School of Applied Biosciences, National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan; Atta-Ur-Rahman School of Applied Biosciences, National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan; Atta-Ur-Rahman School of Applied Biosciences, National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan; Research Centre for Modelling and Simulation, National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan; Atta-Ur-Rahman School of Applied Biosciences, National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan",PeerJ

However, the roles of miR-206 and its related molecular mechanisms in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) are still unclear. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore the effects of miR-206 in OSCC tumorigenesis and development.Methods: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect miR-206 expression in OSCC cell lines and primary tumor tissues. The association of miR-206 expression with clinicopathological factors and prognosis was also analyzed. In addition, the effects of miR-206 on the biological behavior of OSCC cells were investigated. Lastly, the potential regulatory function of miR-206 on K-Ras expression was confirmed.Results: MiR-206 expression was significantly downregulated in OSCC tissue samples and cell lines (both P&lt;0.001). Decreased miR-206 expression was significantly associated with advanced tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage, advanced T classifications (ie, size and/or extent of the primary tumor), positive N classification (ie, spread to regional lymph nodes), and shorter overall survival. In addition, upregulation of miR-206 in Tca8113 cells was able to reduce cell proliferation, invasion, and migration and promote cell apoptosis in vitro. Further, K-Ras was confirmed as a direct target of miR-206 by using luciferase reporter assay.Conclusion: These findings indicate that miR-206 may act as a tumor suppressor in OSCC and could serve as a novel therapeutic agent for miR-based therapy.Keywords: miR-206, oral squamous cell carcinoma, prognosis, proliferation, apoptosis, invasion",NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN,OncoTargets and Therapy

Leukocyte chemotactic migration is required for efficient inflammatory response. Inhibition of leukocyte chemotactic migration to the inflammatory site has been shown to provide therapeutic targets for treating inflammatory diseases. Objective: Our study was designed to discover effective and safe compounds that can inhibit leukocyte chemotactic migration, thus providing possible novel therapeutic strategy for treating inflammatory diseases. Materials and methods: In this study, we used transgenic zebrafish model (Tg:zlyz-EGFP line) to visualize the process of leukocyte chemotactic migration. Then, we used this model to screen the hit compound and evaluate its biological activity on leukocyte chemotactic migration. Furthermore, western blot analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of the hit compound on the AKT or ERK-mediated pathway, which plays an important role in leukocyte chemotactic migration. Results: In this study, using zebrafish-based chemical screening, we identified that the hit compound meisoindigo (25 μM, 50 μM, 75 μM) can significantly inhibit zebrafish leukocyte chemotactic migration in a dose-dependent manner (p = 0.01, p = 0.0006, p < 0.0001). Also, we found that meisoindigo did not affect the process of leukocyte reverse migration (p = 0.43). Furthermore, our results unexpectedly showed that indirubin, the core structure of meisoindigo, had no significant effect on zebrafish leukocyte chemotactic migration (p = 0.6001). Additionally, our results revealed that meisoindigo exerts no effect on the Akt or Erk-mediated signalling pathway.

Conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are prescribed but their long term use is associated with adverse effects. Thus, herbal based medicines are attracting major attraction worldwide as potential therapeutic candidates. Tylophora indica (Burm. f) Merrill is a valuable medicinal plant well known in Ayurvedic practices for its immunomodulatory, anti-oxidant, anti-asthmatic and antirheumatic activities. The present study aimed to elucidate the anti-neuroinflammatory potential of water and hydroalcoholic leaf extracts of micropropagated plants of T. indica using BV-2 microglia activated with lipopolysaccharide as an in vitro model system and development of an efficient reproducible protocol for its in vitro cloning. Non cytotoxic doses of the water and hydroalcoholic extracts (0.2μg/ml and 20μg/ml, respectively) were selected using MTT assay. α-Tubulin, Iba-1 and inflammatory cascade proteins like NFκB, AP1 expression was studied using immunostaining to ascertain the anti-neuroinflammatory potential of these extracts. Further, anti-migratory activity was also analyzed by Wound Scratch Assay. Both extracts effectively attenuated lipopolysaccharide induced microglial activation, migration and the production of nitrite via regulation of the expression of NFκB and AP1 as the possible underlying target molecules.

Furthermore, to evaluate the biological functions related to these biophysical changes, we assessed the cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, intracellular cytoskeleton, and the migratory activity of MNPs@SiO<sub>2</sub>(RITC)-treated hBM-MSCs. Compared to that in the control, cell viability decreased by 10% and intracellular ROS increased by 2-fold due to the induction of 20% higher peroxidized lipid in hBM-MSCs treated with 1.0 &#181;g/&#181;L MNPs@SiO<sub>2</sub>(RITC). Membrane fluidity was reduced by MNPs@SiO<sub>2</sub>(RITC)-induced lipid oxidation in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, cell shrinkage with abnormal formation of focal adhesions and ~30% decreased total traction force were observed in cells treated with 1.0 &#181;g/&#181;L MNPs@SiO<sub>2</sub>(RITC) without specific interaction between MNPs@SiO<sub>2</sub>(RITC) and cytoskeletal proteins. Furthermore, the migratory activity of hBM-MSCs, which was highly related to membrane fluidity and cytoskeletal abnormality, decreased significantly after MNPs@SiO<sub>2</sub>(RITC) treatment. These observations indicated that the migratory activity of hBM-MSCs was impaired by MNPs@SiO<sub>2</sub>(RITC) treatment due to changes in stem-cell biophysical properties and related biological functions, highlighting the important mechanisms via which nanoparticles impair migration of hBM-MSCs.

Those elements can thus promote the development in both societies. In order to conduct the research, the article takes two key components into account that are crucial to understand the linkage between migration and development in the Colombian case: a) The armed conflict, that has lead to the forced and voluntary displacement of millions of Colombians as well as the post-conflict settings and their impact in the creation of transnational fields; b) The role that gender affects the situation and condition of migrants, as the Colombian migrant collective is characterized by a high degree of feminization.

EGF, the most important ligand for the EGFR, is a potent mitogenic agent that stimulates proliferation, survival, migration and differentiation into the oligodendrocyte lineage.  Other ErbB receptors also activate several intracellular pathways for oligodendrocyte specification, migration and survival.

The goal of the current study is to analyze the genetic variations of the PUUV strains and possible presence of chimeric and reassortant variants among the PUUV strains circulating in bank vole populations in the Trans-Kama area of the RT. Complete S segment CDS as well as partial M and L segment coding nucleotide sequences were obtained from 40 PUUV-positive bank voles and used for the analysis. We found that all PUUV strains belonged to RUS genetic lineage and clustered in two subclades corresponding to the Western and Eastern Trans-Kama geographic areas. PUUV strains from Western Trans-Kama were related to the previously identified strain from Teteevo in the Pre-Kama area. It can be suggested that the PUUV strains were introduced to the Teteevo area as a result of the bank voles’ migration from Western Trans-Kama. It also appears that physical obstacles, including rivers, could be overcome by migrating rodents under favorable circumstances. Based on results of the comparative and phylogenetic analyses, we propose that bank vole distribution in the Trans-Kama area occurred upstream along the river valleys, and that watersheds could act as barriers for migrations. As a result, the diverged PUUV strains could be formed in closely located populations. In times of extensive bank vole population growth, happening every 3–4 years, some regions of watersheds may become open for contact between individual rodents from neighboring populations, leading to an exchange of the genetic material between divergent PUUV strains.","OpenLab “Gene and Cell Technologies”, Institute of Fundamental Medicine and Biology, Kazan Federal University, 420008 Kazan, Russia; OpenLab “Gene and Cell Technologies”, Institute of Fundamental Medicine and Biology, Kazan Federal University, 420008 Kazan, Russia; OpenLab “Gene and Cell Technologies”, Institute of Fundamental Medicine and Biology, Kazan Federal University, 420008 Kazan, Russia; OpenLab “Gene and Cell Technologies”, Institute of Fundamental Medicine and Biology, Kazan Federal University, 420008 Kazan, Russia; OpenLab “Gene and Cell Technologies”, Institute of Fundamental Medicine and Biology, Kazan Federal University, 420008 Kazan, Russia; OpenLab “Omics Technology”, Institute of Fundamental Medicine and Biology, Kazan Federal University, 420008 Kazan, Russia; Kazan Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, 420012 Kazan, Russia; Kazan Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, 420012 Kazan, Russia; Kazan Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, 420012 Kazan, Russia; Department of Infection Biology and Microbiomes, Institute of Infection, Veterinary and Ecological Sciences, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L3 5RF, UK; OpenLab “Gene and Cell Technologies”, Institute of Fundamental Medicine and Biology, Kazan Federal University, 420008 Kazan, Russia; OpenLab “Gene and Cell Technologies”, Institute of Fundamental Medicine and Biology, Kazan Federal University, 420008 Kazan, Russia; OpenLab “Gene and Cell Technologies”, Institute of Fundamental Medicine and Biology, Kazan Federal University, 420008 Kazan, Russia",Pathogens

In the decades before 2006, tools available to quantify growth, dispersal, and survival of juvenile salmon in this complex channel network were limited.Fortunately, thanks to technological advances such as acoustic telemetry and chemical and structural otolith analysis, much has been learned over the past decade about the role of the Delta in the life cycle of juvenile salmon. Here, we review new science between 2006and 2016 that sheds light on how different life stages and runs of juvenile salmon grow, move, and survive in the complex channel network of the Delta. One of the most important advances during the past decade has been the widespread adoption of acoustic telemetry techniques. Use of telemetry has shed light on how survival varies among alternative migration routes and the proportion of fish that use each migration route. Chemical and structural analysis of otoliths has provided insights about when juveniles left their natal river and provided evidence of extended rearing in the brackish or saltwater regions of the Delta. New advancements in genetics now allow individuals captured by trawls to be assigned to specific runs. Detailed information about movement and survival in the Delta has spurred development of agent-based models of juvenile salmon that are coupled to hydrodynamic models.

Pentagamaboronon-0 Sorbitol (PGB-0-So) is an aquoeous formulation of curcumin analog, PGB-0, with sorbitol. This compound has been developed as an anti-cancer chemotherapeutic agent and a boron carrying pharmaceutical for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). The aims of this study are to investigate antimetastatic activities of PGB-0-So against HER2-overexpressed MCF-7 breast cancer (MCF-7/HER2) cells. The MTT cytotoxicity assay of PGB-0-So exhibited cytotoxic effect with an IC50 value of 35 μM. The testing of anti-migration activity using the scratch wound healing assay demonstrated that PGB-0-So inhibited the closure of the wound on MCF-7/HER2 cells compare to the control. Furthermore, PGB-0-So was able to suppress matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 activities, based on the gelatin zymography assay. In conclusion, PGB-0-So has potency to be developed as an anti-cancer agent against metastatic breast cancer.

Copper complexed DSF (DSF-Cu) also possesses anti-tumor and chemosensitizing properties; however, its molecular mechanisms of action remain unclear. Here we investigated malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) suppressive effects of DSF-Cu and the molecular mechanisms involved. DSF-Cu inhibited growth of the murine as well as human MPM cells in part by increasing levels of ubiquitinated proteins. DSF-Cu exposure stimulated apoptosis in MPM cells that involved activation of stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) p38 and JNK1/2, caspase-3, and cleavage of poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase, as well as increased expression of sulfatase 1 and apoptosis transducing CARP-1/CCAR1 protein. Gene-array based analyses revealed that DSF-Cu suppressed cell growth and metastasis-promoting genes including matrix metallopeptidase 3 and 10. DSF inhibited MPM cell growth and survival by upregulating cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip1, IGFBP7, and inhibitors of NF-κB such as ABIN 1 and 2 and Inhibitory κB (IκB)α and β proteins. DSF-Cu promoted cleavage of vimentin, as well as serine-phosphorylation and lysine-63 linked ubiquitination of podoplanin. Administration of 50 mg/kg DSF-Cu by daily i.p injections inhibited growth of murine MPM cell-derived tumors in vivo. Although podoplanin expression often correlates with metastatic disease and poor prognosis, phosphorylation of serines in cytoplasmic domain of podoplanin has recently been shown to interfere with cellular motility and migration signaling.

Detailed characterization and investigation of the relevant light-matter interactions proved that surfactants addition had a strong impact on the morphology, while also affecting the crystallinity, the optoelectronic properties, and the surface chemistry of the novel photocatalysts. The most efficient photocatalyst (T80) was based on tween 80, a surface-active agent employed for the first time in the synthesis of vanadium oxide materials. T80 presented crystalline nature without structural defects, which are usually centers of e<sup>−</sup> − h<sup>+</sup> recombination. This material also exhibited small crystal size, high porosity, and short migration paths for the charge carriers, enabling their effective separation during photocatalysis. Under UV light illumination, T80 was capable to reduce hexavalent chromium to trivalent up to 70% and showed high yields in degrading methylene blue azo-dye and tetracycline antibiotic water pollutants. This remarkably high bifunctional performance defines T80 as a promising and capable photocatalytic material for both advanced oxidation and reduction processes (AOPs-ARPs).","Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, National Centre for Scientific Research (NCSR) “Demokritos”, 15341 Athens, Greece; Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, National Centre for Scientific Research (NCSR) “Demokritos”, 15341 Athens, Greece; Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, National Centre for Scientific Research (NCSR) “Demokritos”, 15341 Athens, Greece; Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, National Centre for Scientific Research (NCSR) “Demokritos”, 15341 Athens, Greece; Department of Chemistry, Zografou, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 15784 Athens, Greece; Department of Chemistry, Zografou, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 15784 Athens, Greece; Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, National Centre for Scientific Research (NCSR) “Demokritos”, 15341 Athens, Greece; Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, National Centre for Scientific Research (NCSR) “Demokritos”, 15341 Athens, Greece",Materials

Research in skin care and dermatology is constantly looking for new non-invasive solutions, preferably those based on the use of natural certified products, able to accelerate the spontaneous skin repair mechanisms and without altering the skin normal appearance and functionality. The wound healing process in the skin is finely regulated by several factors and orchestrated mechanisms, which modulate the progression and the fitting of different consequent phases, including haemostasis, inflammation, cell proliferation and tissue remodelling. It was previously shown that a patented Triticum vulgare aqueous extract was able to trigger the skin repair process by stimulating new tissue growth and reducing the expression levels of inflammatory mediators, such as IL-6, TNF&alpha;, prostaglandin E2, and nitric oxide.Methods: Scratch assay was performed in Human Dermal Fibroblasts (HDF). The production of fibronectin was measured by gene expression, protein quantification and localization using specific antibodies in HDF. The polymerization of actin was measured using rhodamin-phalloidin in HDF. The epidermal lipid content was estimated in HaCaT (human spontaneously immortalized keratinocytes) using Nile Red staining and the increasing GBA gene expression and activity was demonstrated by RT-PCR and enzymatic activity assay.Results: In the present study, it was demonstrated that the T. vulgare extract enhanced cell migration inducing the synthesis of fibronectin, new actin polymerization and stimulating the expression of the Hyaluronan Synthase 2. Furthermore it improved the restoration of the epidermal barrier stimulating lipid synthesis.Conclusion: In conclusion, we demonstrated that the T. vulgare extract possessed promising potential to be developed as a wound healing promoting agent in skin care and dermatology.Keywords: plant extract, wound healing, skin cell culture, ECM component, epidermal barrier",NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN,"Clinical, Cosmetic and Investigational Dermatology"

However, dispersion and distribution of the nanomaterials inside the polymer matrix is a key challenge to achieve high-performance functional nanocomposites. In this context, for better dispersion, biobased triethyl citrate (TEC) as a dispersing agent in a liquid-assisted extrusion process was used to prepare the nanocomposites of poly (lactic acid) (PLA) and chitin nanocrystals (ChNCs). The aim was to identify the effect of the TEC content on the dispersion of ChNCs in the PLA matrix and the manufacturing of a functional nanocomposite. The nanocomposite film’s optical properties; microstructure; migration of the additive and nanocomposites’ thermal, mechanical and rheological properties, all influenced by the ChNC dispersion, were studied. The microscopy study confirmed that the dispersion of the ChNCs was improved with the increasing TEC content, and the best dispersion was found in the nanocomposite prepared with 15 wt% TEC. Additionally, the nanocomposite with the highest TEC content (15 wt%) resembled the mechanical properties of commonly used polymers like polyethylene and polypropylene. The addition of ChNCs in PLA-TEC15 enhanced the melt viscosity, as well as melt strength, of the polymer and demonstrated antibacterial activity.","Division of Materials Science, Luleå University of Technology, SE-97 187 Luleå, Sweden; Institute for Material Engineering and Plastics Processing, University of Applied Sciences Eastern Switzerland, CH-8640 Rapperswil, Switzerland; Department for Sustainable Food Process (DiSTAS), Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Via Emilia Parmense 84, 29122 Piacenza, Italy; Division of Materials Science, Luleå University of Technology, SE-97 187 Luleå, Sweden; Division of Materials Science, Luleå University of Technology, SE-97 187 Luleå, Sweden; Division of Materials Science, Luleå University of Technology, SE-97 187 Luleå, Sweden",Molecules

A question remains as to what the implications are of different social adaptations to long-term vulnerability of small-scale human societies. A stylized agent-based model is presented that captures small-group decision making on movements and resource use in ancient arid environments. The impact of various assumptions concerning storage, exchange, sharing, and migration on indicators of aggregation and sustainability are explored. Climate variability is found to increase the resilience of population levels at the system level. Variability reduces the time a population stays in one location and can degrade the soils. In addition to climate variability, the long-term population dynamics is mainly driven by the level of storage and the decision rules governing when to migrate and with whom to exchange.","School of Human Evolution and Social Change, Arizona State University",Ecology and Society

With conventional treatment, the median survival time is typically 3-4 years, although it can be extended to 5-7 years or longer with advanced treatments. Recent research indicated that an increase in osteoclast (OC) activity is often associated withmultiple myeloma (MM) and that a decrease inosteoblast (OB) activity contributesto the osteolytic lesions in MM. Normally, the populations of OCs and OBs are inequilibrium, and an imbalance in this statecontributes to the development of lesions.A multi-scale agent-based multiple myeloma model was developed to simulate the proliferation, migration and death of OBs and OCs. Subsequently, this model was employed to investigate the efficacy of thethree most commonly used drugs for MM treatment under the following two premises: the reduction in the progression of MM and the re-establishment of the equilibrium between OCs and OBs.The simulated results not only demonstrated the capacity of the model to choose optimal combinations of the drugs but also showed that the optimal use of the three drugs can restore the balance between OCs and OBs as well as kill MMs. Furthermore, the drug synergism analysis function of the model revealed that restoring the balance between OBs and OCs can significantly increase the efficacy of drugs against tumor cells.",NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN,PLoS ONE

To evaluate the anti-invasive effect of ethanol extracts of rhizome of Dryopteris crassirhizoma (EEDC) in matrix invasion and formation of functional invadopodia and to determine the anti-tumor effect of EEDC in a mouse model of mandibular invasion by gingival squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Methods . The rhizome of D crassirhizoma was extracted in ethanol. The anti-invasive effect of EEDC was analyzed with a Matrigel-coated transwell invasion and 3D culture system. Crucial factors related to the control of cancer cell invasion by EEDC were determined using a human protease array. Molecular evidence supporting the anti-invasive effect of EEDC in oral SCC (OSCC) cells used an invadopodia-mediated extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation; an in vivo athymic mouse model was also provided. Results . EEDC treatment (10 µg/mL) suppressed transwell migration and invasion of HSC-3 OSCC cells without cytotoxicity. Decreased levels of matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-7, kalikrein 10, cathepsin V, MMP-2, and cathepsin D were also found in EEDC-treated HSC-3 cells based on human protease array. The anti-invasive effects of EEDC involved the suppression of invadopodia-mediated ECM degradation via inhibition of globular-actin elongation. The anti-invasive effect resulting from disturbance of functional invadopodia formation by EEDC was observed even at a low concentration of 5 µg/mL. The phosphorylation of cortactin involved in functional invadopodia formation was decreased at EEDC concentrations that inhibited invadopodia formation. The anti-tumor effect of EEDC was also observed in a mouse xenograft model. Administration of EEDC resulted in inhibition of tumor growth and progression. Conclusions . EEDC represents a potential anti-invasive and anti-tumor agent in cancer control.","Sungkyunkwan University, Jangan Gu, Suwon City, Gyunggi Do, Republic of Korea; COSMAX Inc, Seongnam, Republic of Korea; COSMAX Inc, Seongnam, Republic of Korea; Eulji University, Seongnam, Republic of Korea",Integrative Cancer Therapies

In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), αv integrin is a crucial mediator of multicellular clustering and collective movement in vitro; however, its contribution to metastatic spread remains to be addressed. According to the emerging therapeutic concept, dissociation of tumor clusters into single cells could significantly suppress metastasis-seeding ability of carcinomas. This study aimed to investigate the anti-OSCC potential of novel endostatin-derived polypeptide PEP06 as a cluster-dissociating therapeutic agent in vitro. Firstly, we found marked enrichment of αv integrin in collectively invading multicellular clusters in human OSCCs. Our study revealed that metastatic progression of OSCC was associated with augmented immunostaining of αv integrin in cancerous lesions. Following PEP06 treatment, cell clustering on fibronectin, migration, multicellular aggregation, anchorage-independent survival and colony formation of OSCC were significantly inhibited. Moreover, PEP06 suppressed αv integrin/FAK/Src signaling in OSCC cells. PEP06-induced loss of active Src and E-cadherin from cell–cell contacts contributed to diminished collective migration of OSCC in vitro. Overall, these results suggest that PEP06 polypeptide 30 inhibiting αv integrin/FAK/Src signaling and disrupting E-cadherin-based intercellular junctions possesses anti-metastatic potential in OSCC by acting as a cluster-dissociating therapeutic agent.

Collective tissue dynamics-understood as population behaviour arising from the interplay of the constituting discrete cells-can be studied with on- and off-lattice agent-based models. However, classical on-lattice agent-based models, also known as cellular automata, fail to replicate key aspects of collective migration, which is a central instance of collective behaviour in multicellular systems. To overcome drawbacks of classical on-lattice models, we introduce an on-lattice, agent-based modelling class for collective cell migration, which we call biological lattice-gas cellular automaton (BIO-LGCA). The BIO-LGCA is characterised by synchronous time updates, and the explicit consideration of individual cell velocities. While rules in classical cellular automata are typically chosen ad hoc, rules for cell-cell and cell-environment interactions in the BIO-LGCA can also be derived from experimental cell migration data or biophysical laws for individual cell migration. We introduce elementary BIO-LGCA models of fundamental cell interactions, which may be combined in a modular fashion to model complex multicellular phenomena. We exemplify the mathematical mean-field analysis of specific BIO-LGCA models, which allows to explain collective behaviour. The first example predicts the formation of clusters in adhesively interacting cells. The second example is based on a novel BIO-LGCA combining adhesive interactions and alignment.

Here, we investigated the effect of melatonin on the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in endometriotic endometrial epithelial cells and explored the pathway that might be involved. Methods This hospital-based study included 60 women of reproductive age using the endometrium for immunohistochemistry, 6 women of reproductive age undergoing bilateral tubal ligation and 6 patients with endometriosis for isolation of endometrial epithelial cells or subsequent analysis, respectively. We examined the expression of Notch1/Numb signaling and EMT markers by immunohistochemistry analysis and western blot analysis, the invasion and migration of endometrial epithelial cells by transwell assays, and the cell proliferation by CCK8 assays. Results Compared with normal endometrium, the endometriotic eutopic endometrium showed increased expression of Notch1, Slug, Snail, and N-cadherin, and decreased expression of E-cadherin and Numb. Melatonin or Notch inhibition by specific inhibitor blocked 17β-estradiol-induced cell proliferation, invasion, migration and EMT-related markers in both normal and endometriotic epithelial cells. Conclusions Our data suggest that aberrant expression of Notch1/Numb signaling and the EMT is present in endometriotic endometrium. Melatonin may block 17β-estradiol-induced migration, invasion and EMT in normal and endometriotic epithelial cells by upregulating Numb expression and decreasing the activity of the Notch signaling pathway.","Center for Reproductive Medicine, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University; Center for Reproductive Medicine, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University; Department of Urology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University; Center for Reproductive Medicine, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University",Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology

Therefore, this paper assesses literature on water-related human responses, the quantification and conceptualization methods and theories used, the scale at which models are applied, and the extent to which findings are used to make policy recommendations. We found system dynamics approaches mostly applied for policy evaluations, but often with a limited integration of human behavior beyond water use; agent-based models seem to be suited for policy analysis, but only limitedly applied for that purpose; and statistical studies to present the widest range of human responses and explanatory factors, but without making the behavioral mechanisms explicit. In fact, only a limited number of studies was based on behavioral theories. Based on these findings we recommend eight steps to facilitate quantification of human responses for water resources planning purposes.","Deltares, Boussinesqweg 1, 2629 HV Delft, The Netherlands; Deltares, Boussinesqweg 1, 2629 HV Delft, The Netherlands; Deltares, Boussinesqweg 1, 2629 HV Delft, The Netherlands",Sustainability

Non-invasive high resolution imaging is required to track the cells and evaluate clinical relevance after cell transplantation. The hypothesis that MRI can provide in vivo detection and long-term observation of MNCs labeled with manganese contrast-agent was investigated in ischemic rat legs. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The Mn-labeled MNCs were evaluated using 7-tesla high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Intramuscular transplanted Mn-labeled MNCs were visualized with MRI for at least 7 and up to 21 days after transplantation in the ischemic leg. The distribution of Mn-labeled MNCs was similar to that of ¹¹¹In-labeled MNCs measured with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and DiI-dyed MNCs with fluorescence microscopy. In addition, at 1-2 days after transplantation the volume of the site injected with intact Mn-labeled MNCs was significantly larger than that injected with dead MNCs, although the dead Mn-labeled MNCs were also found for approximately 2 weeks in the ischemic legs. The area covered by CD31-positive cells (as a marker of capillary endothelial cells) in the intact Mn-MNCs implanted site at 43 days was significantly larger than that at a site implanted with dead Mn-MNCs. CONCLUSIONS: The present Mn-enhanced MRI method enabled visualization of the transplanted area with a 150-175 µm in-plane spatial resolution and allowed the migration of labeled-MNCs to be observed for long periods in the same subject. After further optimization, MRI-based Mn-enhanced cell-tracking could be a useful technique for evaluation of cell therapy both in research and clinical applications.",NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN,PLoS ONE

However, many patients fail to respond and relapse after this treatments due to the acquisition of chemo-resistance. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel drugs that could reverse the resistant phenotype. Curcumin, the constituent of the spice turmeric has been shown to have anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-proliferative properties in several tumor types. However, use of curcumin has been limited due to its poor bio-absorption. Recently, a novel class of curcumin analogs, based on diarylidenylpiperidones (DAP), has been developed by incorporating a piperidone link to the beta-diketone structure and fluoro substitutions on the phenyl groups. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of H-4073, a parafluorinated variant of DAP, using both in vitro and in vivo head and neck cancer models. Our results demonstrate that H-4073 is a potent anti-tumor agent and it significantly inhibited cell proliferation in all the HNSCC cell lines tested in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, pretreatment of cisplatin-resistant HNSCC cell lines with H-4073 significantly reversed the chemo-resistance as observed by cell viability assay (MTT), apoptosis assay (Annexin V binding) and cleaved caspase-3 (Western blot). H-4073 mediated its anti-tumor effects by inhibiting JAK/STAT3, FAK, Akt and VEGF signaling pathways that play important roles in cell proliferation, migration, survival and angiogenesis. In the SCID mouse xenograft model, H-4073 significantly enhanced the anti-tumor and anti-angiogenesis effects of cisplatin, with no added systemic toxicity. Interestingly, H-4073 inhibited tumor angiogenesis by blocking VEGF production by tumor cells as well as directly inhibiting endothelial cell function. Taken together, our results suggest that H-4073 is a potent anti-tumor agent and it can be used to overcome chemotherapy resistance in HNSCC.",NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN,PLoS ONE

These trips take place in the winter season, when the temperatures in the North fall and food supply drops. White storks, because of their large size, depend on the wind, thermals, and orographic characteristics of the environment in order to minimize their energy expenditure during flight. In particular, the birds adopt a soaring behavior in landscapes where the thermal uplift and orographic updrafts are conducive. By attaining suitable soaring heights, the birds then use the wind characteristics to glide for hundreds of kilometers. It is therefore expected that white storks would prefer landscapes that are characterized by suitable wind and thermal characteristics, which promote the soaring and gliding behaviors. However, these same landscapes are also potential sites for large-scale wind energy generation. In this study, we used the observed data of the white stork movement trajectories to specify a data-driven agent-based model, which simulates flight behavior of the white storks in a dynamic environment. The data on the wind characteristics and thermal uplift are dynamically changed on a daily basis so as to mimic the scenarios that the observed birds experienced during flight. The flight corridors that emerge from the simulated flights are then combined with the predicted surface on the wind energy potential, in order to highlight the potential risk of collision between the migratory white storks and hypothetical wind farms in the locations that are suitable for wind energy developments. This work provides methods that can be adopted to assess the overlap between wind energy potential and migratory corridors of the migration of birds. This can contribute to achieving sustainable trade-offs between wind energy development and conservation of wildlife and, hence, handling the issues of human&ndash;wildlife conflicts.","Department of Geoinformatics (Z_GIS), University of Salzburg, Schillerstraße 30, 5020 Salzburg, Austria; Max Planck Institute for Ornithology, Vogelwarte Radolfzell, Schlossalee 2, 78315 Radolfzell, Germany; School of Technology, Environments and Design, Discipline of Geography and Spatial Sciences, University of Tasmania, Churchill Avenue, Hobart, Tasmania 7001, Australia",Sustainability

Its function in breast cancer remains to be fully clarified. The aim of this work was to investigate the prognostic value of ME1 and its possible mechanism in breast cancer.Methods: We evaluated ME1 expression in 220 early breast cancer patients with tissue microarray-based immunohistochemistry and explored the relationships between ME1 expression and clinicopathological features. Survival analyses were further performed to determine its prognostic value. The public database was used to confirm tissue microarray results. Further, cell proliferation, migration, invasion ability and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were examined in breast cancer cells.Results: In breast cancer tissues, high ME1 expression was significantly associated with larger tumor size, higher incidence of lymph node metastasis and higher incidence of lymph-vascular invasion. High ME1 expression significantly correlated with worse recurrence-free survival (RFS), and was an independent prognostic factor for RFS, which was confirmed by mRNA results in the public database. In vitro, upregulation of ME1 by transfecting MCF-7 cells with virus vector remarkably enhanced viability, motility and epithelial&ndash;mesenchymal transition (EMT) and decreased ROS levels, whereas knockdown in MDA-MB-468 cells produced totally opposite effects as expected. When pretreated with oxidizing agent, MCF-7 cells overexpressing ME1 lost its motility, whereas MDA-MB-468 cells with knockdown of ME1 restored its motility when pretreated with antioxidant.Conclusion: To our knowledge, these clinical and experiment works first suggested that ME1 may be a novel biomarker and potential therapeutic target for breast cancer metastasis, and its biological effect is mainly controlled by manipulating ROS.Keywords: malic enzyme 1, breast cancer, prognosis, metastasis, reactive oxygen species",NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN,OncoTargets and Therapy

Daly",A C-Terminal Fragment of Chlorotoxin Retains Bioactivity and Inhibits Cell Migration,2019,"Chlorotoxin was originally isolated from the venom of the Israeli scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus, and has potential as a tumor imaging agent based on its selective binding to tumor cells. Several targets have been suggested for chlorotoxin including voltage-gated chloride channels, and it has been shown to have anti-angiogenic activity and inhibit cell migration. The structure of chlorotoxin is stabilized by four disulfide bonds and contains β-sheet and helical structure. Interestingly, the reduced form has previously been shown to inhibit cell migration to the same extent as the wild type, but structural analysis indicates that the reduced form of the peptide does not maintain the native secondary structure and appears unstructured in solution. This lack of structure suggests that a short stretch of amino acids might be responsible for the bioactivity. To explore this hypothesis, we have synthesized fragments of chlorotoxin without disulfide bonds. As expected for such small peptides, NMR analysis indicated that the peptides were unstructured in solution. However, the peptide corresponding to the eight C-terminal residues inhibited cell migration, in contrast to the other fragments. Our results suggest that the C-terminal region plays a critical role in the bioactivity of chlorotoxin.",NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN,Frontiers in Pharmacology
312,"Adam Kane, Daniel Ayllón, Ronan James O’Sullivan, Philip McGinnity, Thomas Eric Reed",Escalating the conflict? Intersex genetic correlations influence adaptation to environmental change in facultatively migratory populations,2022,"Abstract Males and females are often subject to different and even opposing selection pressures. When a given trait has a shared genetic basis between the sexes, sexual conflict (antagonism) can arise. This can result in significant individual‐level fitness consequences that might also affect population performance, whilst anthropogenic environmental change can further exacerbate maladaptation in one or both sexes driven by sexual antagonism. Here, we develop a genetically explicit eco‐evolutionary model using an agent‐based framework to explore how a population of a facultatively migratory fish species (brown trout Salmo trutta) adapts to environmental change across a range of intersex genetic correlations for migration propensity, which influence the magnitude of sexual conflict. Our modelled focal trait represents a condition threshold governing whether individuals adopt a resident or anadromous (sea migration) tactic. Anadromy affords potential size‐mediated reproductive advantages to both males and females due to improved feeding opportunities at sea, but these can be undermined by high background marine mortality and survival/growth costs imposed by marine parasites (sea lice). We show that migration tactic frequency for a given set of environmental conditions is strongly influenced by the intersex genetic correlation, such that one sex can be dragged off its optimum more than the other. When this occurred in females in our model, population productivity was substantially reduced, but eco‐evolutionary outcomes were altered by allowing for sneaking behaviour in males. We discuss real‐world implications of our work given that anadromous salmonids are regularly challenged by sea lice infestations, which might act synergistically with other stressors such as climate change or fishing that impact marine performance, driving populations towards residency and potentially reduced resilience.","School of Biology and Environmental Science and Earth Institute University College Dublin Dublin Ireland; Faculty of Biology Department of Biodiversity, Ecology and Evolution Complutense University of Madrid (UCM) Madrid Spain; Organismal and Evolutionary Biology Research Programme Faculty of Biological and Environmental Sciences University of Helsinki Helsinki Finland; School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences University College Cork Cork Ireland; School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences University College Cork Cork Ireland",Evolutionary Applications

Exosome therapy is an extension of stem cell therapy, and RNA interference (RNAi)-based therapy is a type of advanced precision therapy. Based on the discovery of chronic wound-related genes in diabetes, we combined exosome therapy and RNAi therapy through an engineering approach for the treatment of diabetic chronic wounds. Methods: We combined exosome therapy and RNAi therapy to establish a precision therapy for diabetes-associated wounds via an engineered exosome approach. Results: First, chronic diabetic wounds express low levels of miR-31-5p compared with nondiabetic wounds, and an miR-31-5p mimic was shown to be effective in promoting the proliferation and migration of three wound-related cell types in vitro. Second, bioinformatics analysis, luciferase reporter assays and western blotting suggested that miR-31-5p promoted angiogenesis, fibrogenesis and reepithelization by inhibiting factor-inhibiting HIF-1 (HIF1AN, also named FIH) and epithelial membrane protein-1 (EMP-1). Third, engineered miR-31 exosomes were generated as a miR-31-5p RNAi therapeutic agent. In vivo, the engineered miR-31 exosomes promoted diabetic wound healing by enhancing angiogenesis, fibrogenesis and reepithelization. Conclusion: Engineered miR-31 exosomes are an ideal disease pathophysiology-initiated RNAi therapeutic agent for diabetic wounds.","Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, China; Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, China; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, China; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, China; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, China; Department of Orthopedics, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, China; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, China; Corresponding author.

314,"Lowell T Edgar, Claudio A Franco, Holger Gerhardt, Miguel O Bernabeu",On the preservation of vessel bifurcations during flow-mediated angiogenic remodelling.,2021,"During developmental angiogenesis, endothelial cells respond to shear stress by migrating and remodelling the initially hyperbranched plexus, removing certain vessels whilst maintaining others. In this study, we argue that the key regulator of vessel preservation is cell decision behaviour at bifurcations. At flow-convergent bifurcations where migration paths diverge, cells must finely tune migration along both possible paths if the bifurcation is to persist. Experiments have demonstrated that disrupting the cells' ability to sense shear or the junction forces transmitted between cells impacts the preservation of bifurcations during the remodelling process. However, how these migratory cues integrate during cell decision making remains poorly understood. Therefore, we present the first agent-based model of endothelial cell flow-mediated migration suitable for interrogating the mechanisms behind bifurcation stability. The model simulates flow in a bifurcated vessel network composed of agents representing endothelial cells arranged into a lumen which migrate against flow. Upon approaching a bifurcation where more than one migration path exists, agents refer to a stochastic bifurcation rule which models the decision cells make as a combination of flow-based and collective-based migratory cues. With this rule, cells favour branches with relatively larger shear stress or cell number. We found that cells must integrate both cues nearly equally to maximise bifurcation stability. In simulations with stable bifurcations, we found competitive oscillations between flow and collective cues, and simulations that lost the bifurcation were unable to maintain these oscillations. The competition between these two cues is haemodynamic in origin, and demonstrates that a natural defence against bifurcation loss during remodelling exists: as vessel lumens narrow due to cell efflux, resistance to flow and shear stress increases, attracting new cells to enter and rescue the vessel from regression. Our work provides theoretical insight into the role of junction force transmission has in stabilising vasculature during remodelling and as an emergent mechanism to avoid functional shunting.",NaN; NaN; NaN; NaN,PLoS Computational Biology

For in vitro evaluation, BM cells were extracted from the iliac crests of 13 domestic pigs and then labeled with a T2 contrast agent, Feridex, and/or a fluorescent tissue marker, PKH26. The viability, the proliferation efficiency and the efficacies of Feridex and/or PKH26 labeling were determined. For in vivo validation, the 13 pigs underwent endovascular balloon-mediated intimal damages of the iliofemoral arteries. The labeled or un-labeled BM cells were autotransplanted back to the same pig from which the BM cells were extracted. Approximately three weeks post-cell transplantation, 3.0T T2-weighted MRI was performed to detect Feridex-created signal voids of the transplanted BM cells in the injured iliofemoral arteries, which was confirmed by subsequent histologic correlation.Of the in vitro study, the viability of dual-labeled BM cells was 95-98%. The proliferation efficiencies of dual-labeled BM cells were not significantly different compared to those of non-labeled cells. The efficacies of Feridex- and PKH26 labeling were 90% and 100%, respectively.
