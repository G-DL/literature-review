       "    'abstract': 'The authors in the current work suggested the potential repurposing of omarigliptin (OMR) for neurodegenerative diseases based on three new findings that support the preliminary finding of crossing BBB after a single dose study in the literature. The first finding is the positive results of the docking study with the crystal structures of A<sub>2A</sub> adenosine (A2AAR) and acetylcholine esterase (AChE) receptors. A2AAR is a member of non-dopaminergic GPCR superfamily receptor proteins and has essential role in regulation of glutamate and dopamine release in Parkinson’s disease while AChE plays a major role in Alzheimer’s disease as the primary enzyme responsible for the hydrolytic metabolism of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into choline and acetate. Docking showed that OMR perfectly fits into A2AAR binding pocket forming a distinctive hydrogen bond with Threonine 256. Besides other non-polar interactions inside the pocket suggesting the future of the marketed anti-diabetic drug (that cross BBB) as a potential antiparkinsonian agent while OMR showed perfect fit inside AChE receptor binding site smoothly because of its optimum length and the two fluorine atoms that enables quite lean fitting. Moreover, a computational comparative study of OMR docking, other 12 DPP-4 inhibitors and 11 SGLT-2 inhibitors was carried out. Secondly, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) concentration in rats’ brain tissue was determined by the authors using sandwich GLP-1 ELISA kit bio-analysis to ensure the effect of OMR after the multiple doses’ study. Brain GLP-1 concentration was elevated by 1.9-fold following oral multiple doses of OMR (5 mg/kg/day, p.o. for 28 days) as compared to the control group. The third finding is the enhanced BBB crossing of OMR after 28 days of multiple doses that had been studied using <i>LC</i>-MS/MS method with enhanced liquid–liquid extraction. A modified LC-MS/MS method was established for bioassay of OMR in rats’ plasma (10–3100 ng/mL) and rats’ brain tissue (15–2900 ng/mL) using liquid–liquid extraction. Alogliptin (ALP) was chosen as an internal standard (IS) due to its LogP value of 1.1, which is very close to the LogP of OMR. Extraction of OMR from samples of both rats’ plasma and rats’ brain tissue was effectively achieved with ethyl acetate as the extracting solvent after adding 1N sodium carbonate to enhance the drug migration, while choosing acetonitrile to be the diluent solvent for the IS to effectively decrease any emulsion between the layers in the stated method of extraction. Validation results were all pleasing including good stability studies with bias of value below 20%. Concentration of OMR in rats’ plasma were determined after 2 h of the latest dose from 28 days multiple doses, p.o, 5 mg/kg/day. It was found to be 1295.66 ± 684.63 ng/mL estimated from the bio-analysis regression equation. OMR passed through the BBB following oral administration and exhibited concentration of 543.56 ± 344.15 ng/g in brain tissue, taking in consideration the dilution factor of 10. The brain/plasma concentration ratio of 0.42 (543.56/1295.66) was used to illustrate the penetration power through the BBB after the multiple doses for 28 days. Results showed that OMR passed through the BBB more effectively in the multiple dose study as compared to the previously published single dose study by the authors. Thus, the present study suggests potential repositioning of OMR as antiparkinsonian agent that will be of interest for researchers interested in neurodegenerative diseases.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Introduction. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection risk is associated with many factors related to host-agent-environment. Ethnicity is one of the host factors which was the most studied factor overseas. The prevalence of H. pylori infection was found higher in certain ethnic such among Chinese. Based on migration and transmission theory, it was suspected that H. pylori infection was transmitted by people migrating from areas with a high prevalence of infection to the destination area. Chinese in West Borneo are originated from South China region where the prevalence of H. pylori infection is high. It is estimated that there are differences in the prevalence of H. pylori infection among Chinese compared to the native people of West Borneo, the Dayaknese.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethods. This was a cross-sectional study to determine the differences in the prevalence of H. pylori infection. The study was conducted at St. Antonius General Hospital Pontianak from December 2014 to June 2015 with consecutive sampling method. H. pylori infection prevalence is presented in percentage numbers, while the epidemiological characteristics and endoscopic finding differences among Chinese and Dayaknese were analyzed by bivariate analysis using the chi-square with significance value (p) = 0.05.\\r\\n\\r\\nResults. From a total of 203 subjects in this study, consisted of 102 Chinese subjects and 101 Dayaknese subjects, the prevalence of H. pylori infection was 40.8%. The prevalence among Chinese is higher than Dayaknese, which is 48.0% and 33.7%, respectively. There is no difference in the epidemiological characteristics and endoscopic findings in both ethnic groups.\\r\\n\\r\\nConclusions. The prevalence of H. pylori infection among the Chinese (48.0%) is higher than among Dayaknese (33.7%).

       "    'abstract': 'Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) imaging agents are potent tools for early cancer diagnosis. Almost all of the COX2 imaging agents using celecoxib as backbone were chemically modified in the position of N-atom in the sulfonamide group. Herein, a novel COX-2 probe (CCY-5) with high targeting ability and a near-infrared wavelength (achieved by attaching a CY-5 dye on the pyrazole ring of celecoxib using a migration strategy) was evaluated for its ability to probe COX-2 in human cancer cells. CCY-5 is expected to have high binding affinity for COX-2 based on molecular docking and enzyme inhibition assay. Meanwhile, CCY-5 caused stronger fluorescence imaging of COX-2 overexpressing cancer cells (Hela and SCC-9 cells) than that of normal cell lines (RAW 264.7 cells). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treated RAW264.7 cells revealed an enhanced fluorescence as LPS was known to induce COX-2 in these cells. In inhibitory studies, a markedly reduced fluorescence intensity was observed in cancer cells, when they were co-treated with a COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib. Therefore, CCY-5 may be a selective bioimaging agent for cancer cells overexpressing COX-2 and could be useful as a good monitoring candidate for effective diagnosis and therapy in cancer treatment.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Background:: There are problems in diagnosis of allergy to amide-type local anesthetic agents (ALAs), because definitive diagnosis is not obtained by in vivo tests, which are used for the diagnosis. Consequently, patients may be exposed to risk. There are few diagnoses based on in vitro tests, and there are almost no relevant studies.\\nMethods:: Authors examined involvement of allergic reaction using the leukocyte migration test (LMT) through multiple standpoints in 43 patients who underwent suspected diagnosis of allergy to ALAs.\\nResults:: Rate of LMT-positives was 54%, and especially the positive rate of lidocaine hydrochloride preparations was significantly high. In 15 positives to lidocaine hydrochloride preparations, all cases were indicated as positive in a test with drugs containing antiseptic agent, but only 3 cases were indicated as positive in a test with lidocaine hydrochloride alone. In addition, test with paraben was conducted in 4 cases; 2 cases were confirmed as positive. In relevance of histories of drug or food allergies, development rates of ALAs-allergies were the highest in both allergies, and were 35% and 13%, respectively.\\nConclusions:: There is a high possibility that these adverse reactions were caused by pseudoallergy to drug. Even by allergic reactions, it was assumed that 80% of them might be caused by antiseptic agents such as paraben. In addition, it was suggested that ALAs, especially lidocaine hydrochloride preparations have high antigenicity (sensitizing property). Furthermore, it was considered that patients with past history of drug or food allergies have a high potential for manifestation of the reactions.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Ultrafiltration (UF) membrane technology has drawn much attraction during the past decades to address the challenge of global clean water scarcity. Herein, we proposed a facile methodology to prepare a gradient polysulfone-based (PSf) UF membrane with effective antifouling properties via coupling magnetic field-assisted directional migration and in-situ hydrolysis of fluoro-agent during non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS). The effect of GO-Fe3O4 gradient distribution and fluorosilane (FAS) in-situ surface modification on membrane morphology, hydrophilicity, porosity, water flux and antifouling properties have been investigated. Optical microscopy and SEM-EDX observations indicated that hydrophilic GO-Fe3O4 nanofiller could directionally migrate in casting solution and eventually result in gradient distribution in PSf matrix under the magnetic field. In addition, the surface enrichment of GO-Fe3O4 provided reaction sites to anchor low energy FAS via in-situ hydrolysis on the membrane surface and realized dual antifouling mechanism (fouling-resistance and fouling-release), which guaranteed UF membranes with excellent antifouling properties and remarkable long-term stability and reusability. Our study provided a new incentive to the development of high performance UF membranes by coupling magnetic migration and in-situ surface modification.',\n",

Controlling oxygen vacancies is required since RRAM uses resistive switching (RS) characteristics by redistributing oxygen ions in oxide, and poor oxygen defect control has been shown to significantly reduce RRAM reliability. Therefore, this study designed an F based RRAM device using fluorine anions rather than oxygen defect for the main agent of RS behavior. We developed the F:TiO2 RRAM material using a novel in situ doping method in ALD and investigated its RS behaviors. The Pt/F:TiO2/Pt device exhibited forming-less bipolar RS and self-rectifying behavior by fluorine anion migration, effectively reducing the sneak current in crossbar array architecture RRAM. The doped fluorine passivated and reduced oxygen related defects in TiO2, confirmed by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. Adopting the F-based RS material by ALD provides a viable candidate for high reliability RRAM.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Tuberculosis (TB) is a world-wide health problem with approximately 2 billion people infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb, the causative bacterium of TB). The pathologic hallmark of Mtb infection in humans and Non-Human Primates (NHPs) is the formation of spherical structures, primarily in lungs, called granulomas. Infection occurs after inhalation of bacteria into lungs, where resident antigen-presenting cells (APCs), take up bacteria and initiate the immune response to Mtb infection. APCs traffic from the site of infection (lung) to lung-draining lymph nodes (LNs) where they prime T cells to recognize Mtb. These T cells, circulating back through blood, migrate back to lungs to perform their immune effector functions. We have previously developed a hybrid agent-based model (ABM, labeled GranSim) describing in silico immune cell, bacterial (Mtb) and molecular behaviors during tuberculosis infection and recently linked that model to operate across three physiological compartments: lung (infection site where granulomas form), lung draining lymph node (LN, site of generation of adaptive immunity) and blood (a measurable compartment). Granuloma formation and function is captured by a spatio-temporal model (i.e., ABM), while LN and blood compartments represent temporal dynamics of the whole body in response to infection and are captured with ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In order to have a more mechanistic representation of APC trafficking from the lung to the lymph node, and to better capture antigen presentation in a draining LN, this current study incorporates the role of dendritic cells (DCs) in a computational fashion into GranSim. Results: The model was calibrated using experimental data from the lungs and blood of NHPs. The addition of DCs allowed us to investigate in greater detail mechanisms of recruitment, trafficking and antigen presentation and their role in tuberculosis infection. Conclusion: The main conclusion of this study is that early events after Mtb infection are critical to establishing a timely and effective response. Manipulating CD8+ and CD4+ T cell proliferation rates, as well as DC migration early on during infection can determine the difference between bacterial clearance vs. uncontrolled bacterial growth and dissemination.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The specific structure of the extracellular matrix (ECM), and in particular the density and orientation of collagen fibres, plays an important role in the evolution of solid cancers. While many experimental studies discussed the role of ECM in individual and collective cell migration, there are still unanswered questions about the impact of nonlocal cell sensing of other cells on the overall shape of tumour aggregation and its migration type. There are also unanswered questions about the migration and spread of tumour that arises at the boundary between different tissues with different collagen fibre orientations. To address these questions, in this study we develop a hybrid multi-scale model that considers the cells as individual entities and ECM as a continuous field. The numerical simulations obtained through this model match experimental observations, confirming that tumour aggregations are not moving if the ECM fibres are distributed randomly, and they only move when the ECM fibres are highly aligned. Moreover, the stationary tumour aggregations can have circular shapes or irregular shapes (with finger-like protrusions), while the moving tumour aggregations have elongate shapes (resembling to clusters, strands or files). We also show that the cell sensing radius impacts tumour shape only when there is a low ratio of fibre to non-fibre ECM components. Finally, we investigate the impact of different ECM fibre orientations corresponding to different tissues, on the overall tumour invasion of these neighbouring tissues.',\n",

We focus on the laboratory setting where cancer is treated with chemotherapy drugs, and in this case, the effects of the treatment administration hypothesized by biologists are: the absence of migration and proliferation of tumor cells, which are dying; the stimulation of the production of chemical substances (annexin); the migration of leukocytes in the direction of higher concentrations of chemicals. Here, following the physiological hypotheses made by biologists on the phenomena occurring in these experiments, we introduce an agent-based model reproducing the dynamics of two cell populations (agents), i.e., tumor cells and leukocytes living in the microfluidic chip environment. Our model aims at proof of concept, demonstrating that the observations of the biological phenomena can be obtained by the model on the basis of the explicit assumptions made. In this framework, close adherence of the computational model to the biological results, as shown in the section devoted to the first calibration of the model with respect to available observations, is successfully accomplished.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Dengue is known to transmit between humans and A. aegypti mosquitoes living in neighboring houses. Although transmission is thought to be highly heterogeneous in both space and time, little is known about the patterns and drivers of transmission in groups of houses in endemic settings. We carried out surveys of PCR positivity in children residing in 2-block patches of highly endemic cities of Colombia. We found high levels of heterogeneity in PCR positivity, varying from less than 30% in 8 of the 10 patches to 56 and 96%, with the latter patch containing 22 children simultaneously PCR positive (PCR22) for DEN2. We then used an agent-based model to assess the likely eco-epidemiological context of this observation. Our model, simulating daily dengue dynamics over a 20 year period in a single two block patch, suggests that the observed heterogeneity most likely derived from variation in the density of susceptible people. Two aspects of human adaptive behavior were critical to determining this density: external social relationships favoring viral introduction (by susceptible residents or infectious visitors) and immigration of households from non-endemic areas. External social relationships generating frequent viral introduction constituted a particularly strong constraint on susceptible densities, thereby limiting the potential for explosive outbreaks and dampening the impact of heightened vectorial capacity. Dengue transmission can be highly explosive locally, even in neighborhoods with significant immunity in the human population. Variation among neighborhoods in the density of local social networks and rural-to-urban migration is likely to produce significant fine-scale heterogeneity in dengue dynamics, constraining or amplifying the impacts of changes in mosquito populations and cross immunity between serotypes.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Many mobile agent system-related services and applications require interacting with a mobile agent by passing messages. However, an agent’s mobility raises several challenges in delivering messages to a mobile agent accurately. Consisting of tracking and message delivery phases, most mobile agent location management schemes create or receive many update messages and interaction messages to ensure the effectiveness of the schemes. In addition to downgrading the overall performance of a mobile agent location management scheme, excessive transmission of messages increases the network load. The migration locality of a mobile agent and the interaction rate between mobile agents significantly affect the performance of a mobile agent location management scheme with respect to location management cost. This work presents a novel Dual Home based Scheme (DHS) that can lower the location management costs in terms of migration locality and interaction rate. While the DHS scheme uniquely adopts dual home location management architecture, a selective update strategy based on that architecture is also designed for cost-effective location management of mobile agents. Moreover, DHS is compared with available schemes based on formulations and simulation experiments from the perspective of location management costs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DHS scheme performs satisfactorily in terms of migration locality and interaction rate.',\n",

The prototype design is based on the Agent Technology and using the JADE platform, which is a platform used as a requirement for Multi_agent systems. The used Multi_agent system is of a closed type (Closed Multi_agent System); this is due to the fact that the used agents in this system (mobile and static agents) have been defined and declared in advance, JADE Add-Ons Services have been used to provide additional features that could be used to support the proposed security prototype, like using Inter_Platform Migration Service (IPMS), and JADE Security Add-On (JADE_S).\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Through the work a test has been achieved for the ability of the prototype scalability with low network latency.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Wound healing and fibrosis following myocardial infarction (MI) is a dynamic process involving many cell types, extracellular matrix (ECM), and inflammatory cues. As both incidence and survival rates for MI increase, management of post-MI recovery and associated complications are an increasingly important focus. Complexity of the wound healing process and the need for improved therapeutics necessitate a better understanding of the biochemical cues that drive fibrosis. To study the progression of cardiac fibrosis across spatial and temporal scales, we developed a novel hybrid multiscale model that couples a logic-based differential equation (LDE) model of the fibroblast intracellular signaling network with an agent-based model (ABM) of multi-cellular tissue remodeling. The ABM computes information about cytokine and growth factor levels in the environment including TGFβ, TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6, which are passed as inputs to the LDE model. The LDE model then computes the network signaling state of individual cardiac fibroblasts within the ABM. Based on the current network state, fibroblasts make decisions regarding cytokine secretion and deposition and degradation of collagen. Simulated fibroblasts respond dynamically to rapidly changing extracellular environments and contribute to spatial heterogeneity in model predicted fibrosis, which is governed by many parameters including cell density, cell migration speeds, and cytokine levels. Verification tests confirmed that predictions of the coupled model and network model alone were consistent in response to constant cytokine inputs and furthermore, a subset of coupled model predictions were validated with in vitro experiments with human cardiac fibroblasts. This multiscale framework for cardiac fibrosis will allow for systematic screening of the effects of molecular perturbations in fibroblast signaling on tissue-scale extracellular matrix composition and organization.',\n",

Here, we report that low-cytotoxic concentrations of 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, a DNA demethylating agent, prevent in vitro 3D invasiveness of metastatic melanoma cells and reduce lung metastasis formation in vivo. Results We unravelled that this beneficial effect is in part due to MIR-199A2 re-expression by promoter demethylation. Alone, this miR showed an anti-invasive and anti-metastatic effect. Throughout integration of micro-RNA target prediction databases with transcriptomic analysis after 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine treatments, we found that miR-199a-3p downregulates set of genes significantly involved in invasion/migration processes. In addition, analysis of data from melanoma patients showed a stage- and tissue type-dependent modulation of MIR-199A2 expression by DNA methylation. Conclusions Thus, our data suggest that epigenetic- and/or miR-based therapeutic strategies can be relevant to limit metastatic dissemination of melanoma.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Within the framework of traditional fishery management, we propose an interpretation of natural resource prices. It leads to an economic taxation mechanism based on internal prices and reduces a complex problem of optimal long-term exploitation to a sequence of one-year optimization problems. Internal prices obey natural, economic patterns: the increase in resource amount diminishes taxes, and the rise in the number of “fishers” raises taxes. These taxes stimulate cooperative agent behavior. We consider new problems of optimal fishing, taking into account an adaptive migration of the fish population in two regions. To analyze these problems, we use evolutionary ecology models. We propose a paradoxical method to increase the catch yield through the so-called fish “luring” procedure. In this case, a kind of “giveaway” game occurs, where the region with underfishing becomes more attractive for fish and for catches in the future.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Pd<sub>2</sub>Spm is a dinuclear palladium(II)-spermine chelate with promising anticancer properties against triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a breast carcinoma subset with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. The present study evaluated the in vitro and in vivo anticancer effects of Pd<sub>2</sub>Spm compared to the reference metal-based drug cisplatin. Triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells, non-cancerous MCF-12A breast cells and chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay were used for antiproliferative, antimigratory and antiangiogenic studies. For an in vivo efficacy study, female CBA nude mice with subcutaneously implanted MDA-MB-231 breast tumors were treated with Pd<sub>2</sub>Spm (5 mg/kg/day) or cisplatin (2 mg/kg/day) administered intraperitoneally during 5 consecutive days. Promising selective antiproliferative activity of Pd<sub>2</sub>Spm was observed in MDA-MB-231 cells (IC<sub>50</sub> values of 7.3–8.3 µM), with at least 10-fold lower activity in MCF-12A cells (IC<sub>50</sub> values of 89.5–228.9 µM). Pd<sub>2</sub>Spm inhibited the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells, suppressed angiogenesis in CAM and decreased VEGF secretion from MDA-MB-231 cells with similar potency as cisplatin. Pd<sub>2</sub>Spm-treated mice showed a significant reduction in tumor growth progression, and tumors evidenced a reduction in the Ki-67 proliferation index and number of mitotic figures, as well as increased DNA damage, similar to cisplatin-treated animals. Encouragingly, systemic toxicity (hematotoxicity and weight loss) observed in cisplatin-treated animals was not observed in Pd<sub>2</sub>Spm-treated mice. The present study reports, for the first time, promising cancer selectivity, in vivo antitumor activity towards TNBC and a low systemic toxicity of Pd<sub>2</sub>Spm. Thus, this agent may be viewed as a promising Pd(II) drug candidate for the treatment of this type of low-prognosis neoplasia.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Caesalpinia sappan is studied for several biological activities. The aim of this research is to determine the cytotoxic and antimigratory activities of Caesalpinia sappan active fraction in combination with cisplatin on human TNBC cells (MDA-MB-231). Caesalpinia sappan heartwood was extracted with methanol. Then, several fractions of the methanol extract were obtained by using a liquid-liquid extraction method followed by column chromatography. The cytotoxicity was determined using MTT assay. Synergistic effects were analyzed by calculating the combination index (CI). Migration was examined using wound-healing assay. Levels of MMP2 activity were determined with gelatin zymography assay. The results showed that most of the fractions included in this study exhibited cytotoxic effects against MDA-MB-231 cells, and C fraction demonstrated the highest cytotoxic activity of all fractions. The combination of C-cisplatin revealed a synergistic inhibitory effect on MDA-MB-231 cell growth (CI<1). Furthermore, C fraction, alone and in combination with cisplatin, inhibited migration of MDA-MB-231 and suppressed MMP2 activity. The C fraction isolated from Caesalpinia sappan increased the cytotoxic and antimigratory activities of cisplatin on MDA-MB-231 cells. Based on these findings, the potential of Caesalpinia sappan to act as a supportive agent in metastatic TNBC treatment with cisplatin warrants further exploration.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'In this paper, we describe an application of mono- and dirhamnolipid homologue mixtures of a biosurfactant as a green agent for destabilisation of a dolomite suspension. Properties of the biosurfactant solution were characterised using surface tension and aggregate measurements to prove aggregation of rhamnolipids at concentrations much lower than the critical micelle concentration. Based on this information, the adsorption process of biosurfactant molecules on the surface of the carbonate mineral dolomite was investigated, and the adsorption mechanism was proposed. The stability of the dolomite suspension after rhamnolipid adsorption was investigated by turbidimetry. The critical concentration of rhamnolipid at which destabilisation of the suspension occurred most effectively was found to be 50 mg·dm<sup>−3</sup>. By analysing backscattering profiles, solid-phase migration velocities were calculated. With different amounts of biomolecules, this parameter can be modified from 6.66 to 20.29 mm·h<sup>−1</sup>. Our study indicates that the dolomite suspension is destabilised by hydrophobic coagulation, which was proved by examining the wetting angle of the mineral surface using the captive bubble technique. The relatively low amount of biosurfactant used to destabilise the system indicates the potential application of this technology for water treatment or modification of the hydrophobicity of mineral surfaces in mineral engineering.',\n",

A duty to rescue is a moral rather than legal duty and imposes on a bystander to take an active role in preventing serious harm to someone else. Examples of circumstances range from person-to-person intimate rescue to saving those in poverty, even in distant parts of the world.[1]\\n\\n\\nSince 2008, an average of twenty million people per year have been displaced by weather events.[2] Circumstances like being thrust from homes under the threat of fire, mudslide, and flooding vary greatly from long-term changes like land becoming too arid for crops or temperatures increasing annually gradually pushing up the number of heat-related deaths, with the area slowly becoming uninhabitable. Imminence in fleeing affects resettling and need for rescue with important implications for how the duty to rescue might apply.\\n\\n\\nThis paper reevaluates the ethical framing of the duty to rescue and, while it is arguably a stretch, applies it to climate migration.\\xa0 Climate migration has become common and is expected to increase due to rises in sea level, increases in weather events that make areas uninhabitable, and changes to land that preclude farming or other necessary land uses. We argue that a duty to rescue may help highlight who has moral obligations to whom.\\xa0 Because the problem is so large in scope, we suggest a change in the ethical limits to humans\\' duty to rescue other humans who are in distress. We imagine an expansion or extension of the duty to rescue to meet some of the basic needs created by climate migration.\\xa0Yet how it should expand, and how much depend on ethical framing and practical limitations.\\n\\n\\nl.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0Expanding the Geographical Boundaries\\n\\n\\nTwo commonly recognized emergencies, Hurricane Katrina in the case of weather events and the current COVID-19 pandemic, provide a historical and current backdrop to evaluate ethical obligations as more disasters displace people. A significant reassessment of the ethical scope of an obligation to rescue in the case of weather events will be limited by the ability to render aid to those in distress in the case of a planet-wide weather catastrophe.\\xa0The problems may overwhelm the ability to rescue or the reasonableness of attempting rescue.\\n\\n\\nThe extent of the moral obligation borne by humans to other humans in the case of a weather event has been largely defined by its locality and limited geographic influence. Whether we are imagining the scope of ethical obligation in the case of hurricane, flood, tornado, drought, or wildfire events, the perceived ethical obligation is significantly defined by the limited impact of these weather events on people outside the zone of the weather event\\'s direct impact, yet close to that zone. A hurricane affecting New Orleans will not have immediate impact on the residents of California or even those on the northeast coast of the United States until a later time. Wildfires in the Pacific Northwest do not impair the ability of those in the rest of the country to come forward with assistance. But as climate migration crosses international borders, and climate events occur simultaneously in many regions, a more expansive duty to rescue may provide the ethical impulse to help those who live afar or migrate long distances.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIn this respect, the need for help in the event of widespread climate migration due to global warming is more like a pandemic than a weather event. Its broad impact area diminishes the capability of nearly the entire balance of the human population to help due to those populations\\' awareness that they will, in short order, have the same need for the same resources, from the same cause. Those living near current flood zones may find their historically safe havens are also a flood zone. Those previously best positioned to rescue may find themselves also needing to relocate. Thus, we may observe the need for new rescuers.\\n\\n\\nll.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0The Rule of Rescue\\n\\n\\nThe Rule of Rescue as defined by Al Jonsen describes the moral impetus or knee jerk reaction to save identifiable people facing death.[3] A duty to rescue has since been expanded beyond imminent death and beyond the near and identifiable. But there are limitations. For example, by most accounts, the ethical duty tends not to require extreme bodily risk or financial depletion. In comparing Good Samaritans to humanitarians, Scott M. James argues the duty to rescue arises from unique dependence, but the ethical obligation to help strangers through humanitarian aid is of a different nature.[4] The wrongness of failing to help is arguably more egregious when one is in a unique position to help. Like in the tragedy of the commons, where there is no unique positioning, when the global community is called upon to help, each individual in it may feel less obliged to do so. Climate migration falls in between—it requires helping strangers, yet it may move forward without anyone seeing themselves as uniquely positioned to help until those strangers become part of communities, at which time, there may be more moral justification to help a community member in need.\\n\\n\\nGenerally, arguments about Good Samaritans hinge on extraordinary acts, praiseworthy because they are acts of compassion, not obligation. Now all US states have Good Samaritan laws[5] which protect helpers from liability for help gone wrong or for a failure to succeed once engaged in an act of rescue. Extraordinary help as a moral good is thus somewhat encouraged through legal protection, but not imposed. Conversely, jobs like firefighting, search and rescue, and emergency medical care tend to oblige employees to take on risks that would be extraordinary if undertaken by the average bystander, yet they are rendered ordinary rescue as part of the job. Three states, Minnesota, Rhode Island, and Vermont have a broad duty to rescue, adding legal considerations to an otherwise moral conundrum. The laws do not require bystanders to take on risk for the sake of rescuing strangers.[6] The moral duty will require looking beyond law, but it is unclear how the moral duty to rescue should be distributed in the case of climate migration. A bare minimum would prevent taking advantage of newcomers, paying sub-minimum wage, and discriminating against them. Yet such a minimum is hardly rescue.\\n\\n\\nlll.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0An Ethical Rather than Legal Duty\\n\\n\\nThe difficulty in defining the duty to rescue as a legal obligation is that it is difficult to determine the extent of risk a rescuer ought to be required to take. The nature of this ethical duty is also arguably tied to the experiences of both the rescuer and the rescued. There are subjective aspects like what someone perceives as a danger that make it difficult to write enforceable laws requiring rescue. It is one thing to expect a rescuer to step into several inches of relatively warm water to lift a person lying face down in a pond and enable them to breathe. It is something altogether different to expect that rescuer to dive into frigid water and attempt to extricate someone trapped in a submerged automobile. As the legal philosopher H.L.A. Hart observed, it is always easier to define application of the core intention of any rule, whether law or ethical norm. It is more difficult to create legal certainty about how the law applies to what he described as “penumbra circumstances”. In the case of a hurricane, it is easier to define what surplus resources are available in areas geographically remote from the impact of the storm and demand, as a moral obligation, that those nearby but outside the area provide assistance. It is more difficult to obligate people, organizations, or governments to supply a quantity of medication or some number of ventilators to an adjacent community when they expect to imminently need them for their own community.\\n\\n\\nIn the early stages of climate migration, the ethics of extreme weather event assistance, a common application of the duty to rescue, will be useful and appropriate. The rising sea levels first experienced by island nations in the South Pacific[7] will not render those living in other coastal communities, those with greater available “high ground”, unable to supply resources to those in need. But when sea level rise and climate change affect more communities simultaneously, albeit in varying degree, the task of defining what response is ethically obligatory becomes increasingly complicated. Pinpointing the obligations of those communities which are resource rich to those communities which are resource deprived, and of those partly affected to those more severely affected may become necessary.\\xa0 The limitations of the traditional duty to rescue could expand to meet the needs.\\n\\n\\nlV.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0Contribution to the Problem\\n\\n\\nMany argue that the duty to rescue may depend on any appropriate claim of those needing rescue. One issue is whether preferential claims among those who can identify the source of the harm should call for a greater duty or whether everyone in need should be approached as like candidates for rescue, shaping the duty as equal across those on the receiving end. As climate change does have human-made causes, there are strong arguments to impose a greater ethical duty on any entity that caused the climate-related problems leading to the mass exodus. While the global north is often implicated in pollution that causes migration, industries like energy, transportation, and agriculture are tied to climate change and associated with significant greenhouse gas emissions.[8] Practices like directing agriculture to less sustainable single crop growth generally made land less farmable. Yet it is difficult to place blame and identify specific causal relationships as most migration is due to many factors. A movement toward greater accountability can be reframed as a greater duty to rescue, a duty to engage in the extraordinary. The fossil fuel industry, for example, should have a larger obligation than the average person. Similarly, some may argue anyone unjustly enriching themselves while contributing to climate change or people who over-consume have an elevated duty to rescue.[9] Climate change lawsuits demonstrate an eagerness to hold governments and corporations accountable, despite difficulty proving causation.\\n\\n\\nV.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0The Most Vulnerable\\n\\n\\nOne ethical dimension of climate migration that remains unexplored is how a duty to rescue applies to vulnerable populations who stand to be left behind or unable to migrate without assistance. Researchers from the Global North working across the Global South are increasingly observing the phenomenon of ethics dumping, where the research ethics of some countries are imposed on research subjects in other countries.[10] In that vein, rescuers should be careful not to impose unwelcome cultural standards or exploit people who are in the process of migrating. There is a gap in discussions reflecting voices that have been left out. The duty to rescue is incomplete without an attempt to understand the ethical experiences of those being rescued. The actual people affected by climate migration who are the least likely to have the means to migrate, or to do so without extreme hardship, should have a voice informing the global community including those in a position to carry out rescue. People who have the means and are young and healthy may easily make decisions to avoid the catastrophic consequences that climate migration brings. However, what about those who are left behind? For example, especially recognizing cultural differences, the homeless community, disabled community, refugees, the elderly community, and women[11] and children may suffer differently and call for more attention. In some parts of the world, human rights are severely constrained. An ethical duty to rescue, with many considerations and variables, may be more justified in the case of those most in need. As climate migration continues and increases significantly, it may be reasonable to ask the local and global community to focus on those least well positioned to migrate successfully. In this context, the use of phenomenology to understand the lived experiences of those migrating, sometimes termed “ethical experiences”, may help flesh out how a duty to rescue takes shape. The discussion of duty and obligation requires an articulation of the ethical experiences (how the local community in need of rescue views the proposed rescue).\\xa0 Then, the obligation to interpret the duty as ‘one shall not’ or ‘one must’ can be focused on the migrants’ needs rather than the rescuers’ feelings of obligation.[12] A revised theory of the duty to rescue taking into account the asymmetrical experiences of communities involved could ensure that the needs of people whose living situations, gender, ethnicity, age, or race impact their ability to even begin the migration process are considered.\\n\\n\\nIn this discussion, the rescuing is directed toward communities /collectives of persons migrating, whether at once or across a period of time. Often, the climate migrant may not be in a state to articulate the nature of this event when it happens, given its subjective proximity. Yet, when communities are given the space and opportunity to articulate their shared values, the ethical action of rescue derives its meaningfulness from the community rather than the rescuers.\\xa0 In other words, allowing climate migrants to explain their feelings can add complexity to what some see as a binary receiver-giver (of rescue) dynamic.\\n\\n\\nThis is necessary because the concept of vulnerable populations is fraught with problematic assumptions. There have been various definitions and criteria to determine what would constitute vulnerable populations.[13] For example, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change[14] identifies and assesses vulnerable populations. These criteria may be helpful. However, they do not provide the full picture. Rather than identifying categorical criteria of vulnerable populations, engaging with people who are experiencing climate migration and listening to their current experiences and concerns helps determine need. Knowing what people need may prevent the kneejerk reaction to label people who are quite resilient yet have appropriate needs “vulnerable”.\\n\\n\\nProceeding with caution is important because the duty to rescue has hierarchical underpinnings of \"us\" and \"them.\" Often when people swoop in to save, there are good and bad consequences of the intervention. We should proceed with caution because often the helper misses the actual needs of those in need. The only way to combat this would be to make sure that people are empowered to inform those agencies that are able to help.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIn addition to more practical approaches, large scale oral histories could allow those who have migrated already to share their experiences. It would be important to capture the lived experiences of people who are already experiencing the consequences of climate migration or of other migration like that due to political or economic extreme events. These experiences could shape our analysis of whether people in fact wish for rescue. If so, further conversations can determine best actions as well as give important insight into what resources might be necessary to empower people now and in the future.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nVl.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0A Duty to Rescue as a Duty to Prepare\\n\\n\\nIf we view Good Samaritans as going above and beyond, then a duty to rescue, something ethically compelled, must bring rescue out of the framework of charity and place it in the context of humanity and obligations. Such a view would also support expanding the geographical reach of the otherwise more proximate duty. The duty may be stronger and take shape in a more workable way if it applies to preparing places expecting to see an influx of people due to climate migration and to helping those most in need. The duty may arise out of expectations of what type of community the place welcoming those migrating due to climate should be—does it want to offer good housing, schooling, and medical care as well as economic opportunity to new people? And if so, at what cost, or with which risks? If the newcomers are viewed as community members rather than strangers, a model of acceptance may lead to better preparation. Some considerations like whether the actions will reasonably help the persons in need of rescue[15] will shape the application of a duty to rescue in the context of climate migration. Similarly, ensuring that people have the chance to articulate their values may help communities support the newcomers. New relationships should not be defined as migrant and rescuer.\\n\\n\\nVoluntariness in participation and not forcing any action deemed rescue would help ensure the human rights of those migrating. In the United States, President Biden issued an executive order addressing impending climate migration steeped in a duty to prepare by making plans for resettlement and to address the impact of climate migration.[16]\\n\\n\\nVll.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0At What Risk?\\n\\n\\nAs we investigate the ethical obligations to meet even basic needs, we must also ask what level of risk is ethically compelled. There is an extraordinary need to integrate newcomers successfully, but it is difficult to stretch an ethical duty to rescue to require all the prerequisites for successful climate migration. Even defining success would create deep ethical arguments. As observed in almost all migrations, extraordinary charitable acts may be the key to success, while an ethical duty to rescue must try to require the important government and community-based basics and ensuring respect for human rights. That is, the migrating people should be rescued from circumstances that contradict basic human rights.\\n\\n\\nRather than comparing communities to bystanders, mere places where people will arrive and need to hash out how to find housing, jobs, education, and opportunity, a duty of preparation may be the key to rescue those disenfranchised by migration. There are cultural, personal, physical, psycho-social, and geopolitical issues surrounding how to best help those needing to permanently relocate. Ethics arguments will certainly range from “do nothing”, which may fail people, to “do everything”, which could waste taxpayer money in futile over-preparation while failing to actually help. Communities must avoid planning exclusively for one scenario only to have it not take place. Striking the balance, a duty to rescue as it could apply to climate migration should set goals of societal integration, and providing the basics like education, housing, food, health care, and job opportunity, the precursors to flourishing. Recommending the extraordinary, morally preferred but perhaps not compulsory, when charitable actors are participating, or when wrongdoers are compensating, may be more workable than seeing the duty to rescue as compelling people or local governments to take on significant financial and personal risk for newcomers. While humanitarian ethics supports helping everyone, it is likely that people who resettle in advance of a need to flee will find themselves with more choices and opportunities. Help is warranted for those with more dire needs. Preparing for them may do just that.\\n\\n\\nVlll.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0Rescue Prior to Migration and Rescue in the Process of Resettlement\\n\\n\\nThe duty to enable the migration in the first-place hints to the inadequacy of a duty to prepare. The traditional duty to rescue perhaps steps in if rescue looks like those geographically just out of harm\\'s way rescuing those in danger. That resembles the traditional moral requirement, or duty to rescue according to the Rule of Rescue. Humanitarian aid typically provided by many institutions makes sense and is in place, although financial support for additional humanitarian aid is always needed.\\xa0Despite having moved to purportedly more capable communities, migrant communities may be able to develop more egalitarian orders of living.\\xa0 Rather than continually being identified as having been rescued, it is important to make sure people keep or make social ties during and after migration.\\xa0 Immigrants often face social isolation.[17] Small shifts in gestural language also have the potential to welcome people and show they are valued. For instance, some migrants may not like questions like “Where are you from?” and “What brings you here?” as they emphasize differences over fitting in.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n\\nThe ethical duty to rescue should be expanded to better match those in need of relocation with a welcome environment and the resources needed to achieve success and fully integrate socially and culturally. Expanding a dialogue that includes the voices of people who have recently migrated whether due to violence, poverty, or climate, could properly frame the extent of the duty. If we are to apply the duty of rescue to climate migration, rescuers should avoid labeling people vulnerable, dependent, or needy, although there is reason to focus on those whose needs are the most dire. A soft duty to rescue people during the course of climate migration can come in the form of preparation. People will need help finding housing, education, access to food, and employment. Ultimately, to help them help themselves may be the best goal. While the obligations should be borne differently by people, whether due to a special responsibility, or a special relationship that creates a clearer duty, the global community must prepare for its role in rescuing those displaced by climate events. By helping those displaced at the start of the climate migration process according to a more commonly held notion of the duty to rescue, and by preparing to incorporate newcomers successfully according to an expanded duty to rescue, effectively a duty to prepare, countries that take on climate refugees may find themselves rewarded by the cultural diversity and workplace talents that people bring. A duty to those at a distance is a reasonable expansion of the duty to rescue. But what one ought to do in the global community varies somewhat from the traditional Rule of Rescue.\\xa0\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n[1] Singer, P. (1972). Famine, Affluence, and Morality.

       "    'abstract': \"Antigenic variation plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of many infectious bacteria and protozoa including Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease. VlsE, a 35 kDa surface-exposed lipoprotein, undergoes antigenic variation during B. burgdorferi infection of mammalian hosts, and is believed to be a critical mechanism by which the spirochetes evade immune clearance. Random, segmental recombination between the expressed vlsE gene and adjacent vls silent cassettes generates a large number of different VlsE variants within the infected host. Although the occurrence and importance of vlsE sequence variation is well established, little is known about the biological mechanism of vlsE recombination. To identify factors important in antigenic variation and vlsE recombination, we screened transposon mutants of genes known to be involved in DNA recombination and repair for their effects on infectivity and vlsE recombination. Several mutants, including those in BB0023 (ruvA), BB0022 (ruvB), BB0797 (mutS), and BB0098 (mutS-II), showed reduced infectivity in immunocompetent C3H/HeN mice. Mutants in ruvA and ruvB exhibited greatly reduced rates of vlsE recombination in C3H/HeN mice, as determined by restriction fragment polymorphism (RFLP) screening and DNA sequence analysis. In severe combined immunodeficiency (C3H/scid) mice, the ruvA mutant retained full infectivity; however, all recovered clones retained the 'parental' vlsE sequence, consistent with low rates of vlsE recombination. These results suggest that the reduced infectivity of ruvA and ruvB mutants is the result of ineffective vlsE recombination and underscores the important role that vlsE recombination plays in immune evasion. Based on functional studies in other organisms, the RuvAB complex of B. burgdorferi may promote branch migration of Holliday junctions during vlsE recombination. Our findings are consistent with those in the accompanying article by Dresser et al., and together these studies provide the first examples of trans-acting factors involved in vlsE recombination.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'To optimize the data migration performance between different supercomputing centers in China, we present TCP-DQN, which is an intelligent TCP congestion control method based on DQN (Deep Q network). The TCP congestion control process is abstracted as a partially observed Markov decision process. In this process, an agent is constructed to interact with the network environment. The agent adjusts the size of the congestion window by observing the characteristics of the network state. The network environment feeds back the reward to the agent, and the agent tries to maximize the expected reward in an episode. We designed a weighted reward function to balance the throughput and delay. Compared with traditional Q-learning, DQN uses double-layer neural networks and experience replay to reduce the oscillation problem that may occur in gradient descent. We implemented the TCP-DQN method and compared it with mainstream congestion control algorithms such as cubic, Highspeed and NewReno. The results show that the throughput of TCP-DQN can reach more than 2 times of the comparison method while the latency is close to the three compared methods.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Phytochemicals as dietary constituents are being explored for their cancer preventive properties. Quercetin is a major constituent of various dietary products and recently its anti-cancer potential has been extensively explored, revealing its anti-proliferative effect on different cancer cell lines, both in vitro and in vivo. Quercetin is known to have modulatory effects on cell apoptosis, migration and growth via various signaling pathways. Though, quercetin possesses great medicinal value, its applications as a therapeutic drug are limited. Problems like low oral bioavailability and poor aqueous solubility make quercetin an unreliable candidate for therapeutic purposes. Additionally, the rapid gastrointestinal digestion of quercetin is also a major barrier for its clinical translation. Hence, to overcome these disadvantages quercetin-based nanoformulations are being considered in recent times. Nanoformulations of quercetin have shown promising results in its uptake by the epithelial system as well as enhanced delivery to the target site. Herein we have tried to summarize various methods utilized for nanofabrication of quercetin formulations and for stable and sustained delivery of quercetin. We have also highlighted the various desirable measures for its use as a promising onco-therapeutic agent.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Cold atmospheric plasma jet (CAPJ) or non-thermal plasma jet has been employed in various biomedical applications based on their functions in bactericidal activity and wound healing. However, the effect of CAPJ generated by a particular composition of gases on wound closure and the underlying mechanisms that regulate wound healing signals remain elusive. In the present study, we investigated the impact of helium (He)- or a gas mixture of He and argon (He/Ar)-generated CAPJ on cell proliferation, which is a pivotal step during the wound healing process. With careful treatment duration control, He/Ar-CAPJ effectively induced keratinocyte proliferation and migration mediated through the activation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell cycle progression, which was evidenced by a decrease in E-cadherin levels and increases in N-cadherin, cyclin D1, Ki-67, Cdk2, and p-ERK levels. Rat wound healing studies showed that He/Ar-CAPJ treatment facilitated granulation tissue formation and mitigated inflammation in cutaneous tissue, resulting in accelerated wound closure. These findings highlight the possibility that He/Ar-CAPJ can be developed as a therapeutic agent for enhancing wound healing.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Immunotherapy of bladder cancer is known to have favorable effects, although it is difficult to determine which patients will show a good response because of the different tumor microenvironments (TME). Here, we developed a bladder cancer-on-a-chip (BCOC) to mimic the TME using three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting and microfluidic technology. We fabricated a T24 and a 5637-cell line-based BCOC that also incorporated MRC-5, HUVEC, and THP-1 cells. We evaluated the effects of TME and assessed the immunologic reactions in response to different concentrations of Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) via live/dead assay and THP-1 monocytic migration, and concentrations of growth factors and cytokines. The results show that cell viability was maintained at 15% filling density in circle-shaped cell constructs at 20 μL/min microfluidic flow rate. A 3D co-culture increased the proliferation of BCOCs. We found that the appropriate time to evaluate the viability of BCOC, concentration of cytokines, and migration of monocytes was 6 h, 24 h, and three days after BGC treatment. Lastly, the immunotherapeutic effects of BCOC increased according to BCG dosage. To predict effects of immunotherapeutic agent in bladder cancer, we constructed a 3D bioprinted BCOC model. The BCOC was validated with BCG, which has been proven to be effective in the immunotherapy of bladder cancer.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Wound infections are serious medical complications that can endanger human health. Latest researches show that conductive composite materials may make endogenous/exogenous electrical stimulation more effective, guide/comb cell migration to the wound, and subsequently promote wound healing. To accelerate infected wound healing, a novel medical silver nanoparticle-doped conductive polymer-based hydrogel system (Ag NPs/CPH) dressing with good conductivity, biocompatibility, and mechanical and antibacterial properties was fabricated. For the hydrogel dressing, Ag NPs/CPH, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and gelatin were used as the host matrix materials, and phytic acid (PA) was used as the cross-linking agent to introduce conductive polyaniline into the matrix, with antibacterial Ag NPs loaded via impregnation. After a series of analyses, the material containing 5\\xa0wt% of PVA by concentration, 1.5\\xa0wt% gelatin, 600\\xa0μL of AN reactive volume, and 600\\xa0μL of PA reactive volume was chosen for Ag NPs/CPH preparation. XPS and FTIR analysis had been further used to characterize the composition of the prepared Ag NPs/CPH. The test on the swelling property showed that the hydrogels had abundant pores with good water absorption (≈140% within 12\\xa0h). They can be loaded and continuously release Ag NPs. Thus, the prepared Ag NPs/CPH showed excellent antibacterial property with increasing duration of immersion of Ag NPs. Additionally, to evaluate in vivo safety, CCK-8 experiments of HaCat, LO2 and 293T cells were treated with different concentrations of the Ag NPs/CPH hydrogel soaking solution. The experimental results showed the Ag NPs/CPH had no significant inhibitory effect on any of the cells. Finally, an innovative infection and inflammation model was designed to evaluate the prepared Ag NPs/CPH hydrogel dressing for the treatment of severely infected wounds. The results showed that even when infected with bacteria for long periods of time (more than 20\\xa0h), the proposed conductive antibacterial hydrogel could treat severely infected wounds.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Abstract Gadolinium (Gd)-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are chemicals injected intravenously during magnetic resonance imaging to enhance the diagnostic yield. Repeated use of GBCAs causes their deposition in the brain. Such deposition may affect various neuronal cells, including astrocytes. In this study, we examined the effect of GBCAs (Omniscan, Magnescope, Magnevist, and Gadovist) on astrocyte migration, which is critical for formation of neurons during development and maintaining brain homeostasis. All GBCAs increased cell migration and adhesion with increased actin remodelling. Knockdown of integrin αvβ3 by RNAi or exposure to integrin αvβ3 inhibitor reduced astrocyte migration. GBCAs increased phosphorylation of downstream factors of αvβ3, such as FAK, ERK1/2, and Akt. The phosphorylation of all these factors were reduced by RNAi or integrin αvβ3 inhibitor. GBCAs also increased the phosphorylation of their downstream factor, Rac1/cdc42, belonging to the RhoGTPases family. Coexposure to the selective RhoGTPases inhibitors, decreased the effects of GBCAs on cell migration. These findings indicate that GBCAs exert their action via integrin αvβ3 to activate the signaling pathway, resulting in increased astrocyte migration. Thus, the findings of the study suggest that it is important to avoid the repeated use of GBCAs to prevent adverse side effects in the brain, particularly during development.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Due to their differentiation capacity and potent immunosuppressive and pro-angiogenic properties, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been considered as new therapeutic agents in regenerative medicine. Since most of MSC-mediated beneficent effects are a consequence of their paracrine action, we designed MSC-based product “Exosomes Derived Multiple Allogeneic Proteins Paracrine Signaling (Exosomes d-MAPPS), which activity is based on MSCs-derived growth factors and immunomodulatory cytokines capable to attenuate inflammation and to promote regeneration of injured tissues. Interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) and IL-27 were found in high concentrations in Exosomes d-MAPPS samples indicating strong anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive potential of Exosomes d-MAPPS. Additionally, high concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR1) and chemokines (CXCL16, CCL21, CXCL14) were noticed at Exosomes d-MAPPS samples suggesting their potential to promote generation of new blood vessels and migration of CXCR6, CCR7 and CXCR4 expressing cells. Since all proteins which were found in high concentration in Exosomes d-MAPPS samples (IL-1Ra, CXCL16, CXCL14, CCL21, IL-27 and VEGFR1) are involved in modulation of lung, eye, and synovial inflammation, Exosomes d-MAPPS samples were prepared as inhalation and ophthalmic solutions in addition to injection formulations; their application in several patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, osteoarthritis, and dry eye syndrome resulted with significant improvement of biochemical and functional parameters. In conclusion, Exosomes d-MAPPS, due to the presence of important anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and pro-angiogenic factors, represents potentially new therapeutic agent in regenerative medicine that should be further tested in large clinical studies.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Abstract The EFSA Panel\\xa0on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes and Processing Aids (CEP) assessed the safety of N,N‐bis(2‐hydroxyethyl)stearylamine partially esterified with saturated C16/C18 fatty acids (SABOFOG F1), FCM No 1081, which is intended to be used as an antistatic and anti‐fog agent in all types of polymers at up to 2% w/w. It was requested for use in contact with dry food, acidic foods and alcoholic beverages (represented by simulants E, B and C, respectively) with storage up to 6 months at ambient temperature. The migration data provided did not enable the assessment of the safety of applications intended for contact with foods represented by simulants B and C. In the migrate into simulant E, the non‐esterified N,N‐bis(2‐hydroxyethyl)stearylamine was the main constituent. Its mono‐ and di‐esters migrated to a lower extent. According to the data provided, the Panel\\xa0concluded that the substance does not raise concern for genotoxicity and accumulation in humans. Based on the results of 28‐day oral toxicity study with SABOFOG F1 and on the 90‐day oral toxicity study with the read‐across substance bis(2‐hydroxyethyl)oleylamine, the Panel\\xa0considered the current SML(T) of 1.2\\xa0mg/kg food provided a margin sufficiently large to accommodate the uncertainties related to the read‐across approach. Overall, the CEP Panel\\xa0concluded that N,N‐bis(2‐hydroxyethyl)stearylamine, of which at least ■■■■■ is partially or fully esterified with saturated C16/C18 fatty acids is not of safety concern for the consumer when used at up to 2% (w/w) in all polymers intended for contact with foods represented by simulant E for up to 6 months at room temperature. Additionally, the migration of the sum of N,N‐bis(2‐hydroxyethyl)stearylamine and its mono‐ and di‐ester, calculated as N,N‐bis(2‐hydroxyethyl)stearylamine, should not exceed 1.2 mg/kg, i.e. the SML(T) for FCM substances 19 and 20, in which also the migration of the mono‐ and di‐ester of N,N‐bis(2‐hydroxyethyl)stearylamine should be included.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Abstract Background Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific hypertensive disorder characterized by impaired angiogenesis. We postulate that senescence of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), multipotent cells with pro-angiogenic activities, is one of the mechanisms by which systemic inflammation exerts inhibitory effects on angiogenesis in preeclampsia. Methods MSC were isolated from abdominal fat tissue explants removed during medically indicated C-sections from women with preeclampsia (PE-MSC, n\\u2009=\\u200910) and those with normotensive pregnancies (NP-MSC, n\\u2009=\\u200912). Sections of the frozen subcutaneous adipose tissue were assessed for inflammation by staining for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1. Viability, proliferation, and migration were compared between PE-MSC vs. NP-MSC. Apoptosis and angiogenesis were assayed before and after treatment with a senolytic agent (1\\u2009μM dasatinib) using the IncuCyte S3 Live-Cell Analysis System. Similarly, staining for senescence-associated beta galactosidase (SABG) and qPCR for gene expression of senescence markers, p16 and p21, as well as senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) components, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and PAI-1, were studied before and after treatment with dasatinib and compared between PE and NP. Results After in vitro exposure to TNF-alpha, MSC demonstrated upregulation of SASP components, including interleukins-6 and -8 and MCP-1. Staining of the subcutaneous adipose tissue sections revealed a greater inflammatory response in preeclampsia, based on the higher levels of both TNF-alpha and MCP-1 compared to normotensive pregnancies (p <\\u20090.001 and 0.024, respectively). MSC isolated from PE demonstrated a lower percentage of live MSC cells (p\\xa0=\\u20090.012), lower proliferation (p\\u2009=\\u20090.005), and higher migration (p\\u2009=\\u20090.023). At baseline, PE-MSC demonstrated a senescent phenotype, reflected by more abundant staining for SABG (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001), upregulation of senescence markers and SASP components, as well as lower angiogenic potential (p\\xa0<\\u20090.001), compared to NP-MSC. Treatment with dasatinib increased significantly the number of apoptotic PE-MSC compared to NP-MSC (0.011 vs. 0.093) and decreased the gene expression of p16 and six SASP components. The mechanistic link between senescence and impaired angiogenesis in PE was confirmed by improved angiogenic potential of PE-MSC (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001) after dasatinib treatment. Conclusions Our data suggest that MSC senescence exerts inhibitory effects on angiogenesis in preeclampsia. Senolytic agents may offer the opportunity for mechanism-based therapies.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Cell migration and proliferation are important for proper wound healing after skin injury. Recent studies have shown that compounds from plants could promote cell migration and proliferation. Tracheloside, which is a plant lignan, has been found to promote the growth of HaCaT cells over 40% compared to other compounds tested based on a cell proliferation assay. An in vitro scratch assay confirmed the healing activity of tracheloside (more than 2-fold increased healing activity after 24 hours of treatment compared with the control) and revealed that this activity is better than that of allantoin (1.2-fold increased after 24 hours of treatment compared with the control), a positive control. With western blot results, wound healing with tracheloside occurred through the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Therefore, tracheloside is a good candidate to promote wound healing and could be developed as a therapeutic agent for wound treatment or used as a leading compound with higher activity.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'As shown in our previous study, sinomenine hydrochloride (SH), the major bioactive alkaloid isolated from Sinomenium acutum Rehd. et Wils. (Fam. Menispermaceae), initiates the autophagy-mediated death of human glioblastoma cells by generating reactive oxygen species and activating the autophagy-lysosome pathway. However, its effects on the migration and invasion of human glioblastoma cells have not yet been elucidated. Therefore, human glioblastoma U87 and SF767 cells were treated with SH (0.125 and 0.25 mM) for 24 h, and cell migration and invasion were assessed using scratch wound healing, migration and invasion assays. SH promoted G0/G1 phase arrest, inhibited the migration and invasion of the two cell lines, suppressed the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) and the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/-9, triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, reversed the exogenous epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by the inflammatory microenvironment and the endogenous EMT. Additionally, NFκB p65 overexpression blocked the SH-mediated inhibitory effects on MMP-2/-9 expression and cell invasion. SH-induced autophagy was reduced in CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP) or autophagy-related 5 (ATG5)-silenced human glioblastoma cells and cells treated with 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) or 3-methyladenine (3-MA), as shown by the decreased levels of the microtubule-associated protein light chain 3B (LC3B)-II and autophagic vacuoles (AVs) stained with monodansylcadaverine (MDC), respectively. Moreover, knockdown of CHOP or ATG5 and treatment with 4-PBA or 3-MA abolished the SH-mediated inhibition of mesenchymal markers (vimentin, Snail and Slug) expression and cell invasion, respectively. Importantly, SH also regulated the above related pathways in nude mice. Based on these findings, SH inhibited cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest, and attenuated the metastasis of U87 and SF767 cells by suppressing MMP-2/-9 expression and reversing the endogenous and exogenous EMT in vitro and/or in vivo. Thus, SH might be a new potential anti-metastasis agent for the treatment of human glioblastoma.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"BACKGROUND: Advances in HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) has reduced mortality in people living with HIV (PLHIV), resulting in an ageing population of PLHIV. Knowledge of demographic details such as age, geographical location and sex, will aid in the planning of training and resource allocation to effectively care for the future complex health needs of PLHIV. METHODS: An agent-based, stochastic, geographical model was developed to determine the current and future demographic of PLHIV in Australia. Data and parameters were sourced from Australia's National HIV Registry and peer reviewed literature. Processes that were simulated include progression to AIDS, mortality and internal migration. FINDINGS: The model estimates the mean age of PLHIV in Australia is increasing at a rate of 0.49 years each year. The expected proportion of PLHIV in over 55 years is estimated to increase from 25.3% in 2010 to 44.2% in 2020. Median age is lower in inner-city areas of the capital cities than in rural areas. The areas with the highest prevalence of HIV will continue to be capital cities; however, other areas will have greater percentage growth from 2010 to 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The age of the population of people living with HIV is expected to increase considerably in the future. As the population of PLHIV ages, specialist clinical training and resource provision in the aged care sector will also need to be addressed.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'A flame retardant named TAD was synthesized by the reaction of 9,10-Dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphaphenanthrene-10-oxide and triallyl isocyanurate at first. Then, novel flameretarded materials based on PBT and PET resin were formulated via melt blending with TAD, expandable graphite (EG), and a mixture of both. The effect of flame retardant type and TAD content on the flame behavior of PBT/PET blend was carefully investigated. TAD contributed towards higher LOI value and better UL-94 performance than EG. However, the best V-0 rating in the UL-94 test was achieved by the incorporation of TAD/EG mixture into the resin matrix. TAD/EG combination exhibited clear synergistic effect on both reducing the flaming intensity and increasing the residual char layer, as confirmed by cone calorimeter tests and TGA results. SEM images combined with XPS analysis revealed that expansion and migration of EG locked the P-containing radicals from decomposing TAD into the condensed phase, which led to the formation of compact and continuous char layers. All the results in our studies demonstrate that incorporation of TAD with a charring agent EG is an effective and promising technique to develop flame-retarded PBT/PET material, which has high potential for applications in the areas of electronic devices, household products, and automotive parts.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Viruses are a possible cause for Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) as an environmental factor related to SS onset, which exhibits exocrine gland dysfunction and the emergence of autoantibodies. Although retroviruses may exhibit lymphocytic infiltration into exocrine glands, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) has been postulated to be a causative agent for SS. Transgenic mice with HTLV-1 genes showed sialadenitis resembling SS, but their phenotypic symptoms differed based on the adopted region of HTLV-1 genes. The dominance of <i>tax</i> gene differed in labial salivary glands (LSGs) of SS patients with HTLV 1-associated myelopathy (HAM) and adult T-cell leukemia. Although HTLV-1 was transmitted to salivary gland epithelial cells (SGECs) by a biofilm-like structure, no viral synapse formation was observed. After infection to SGECs derived from SS patients, adhesion molecules and migration factors were time-dependently released from infected SGECs. The frequency of the appearance of autoantibodies including anti-Ro/SS-A, La/SS-B antibodies in SS patients complicated with HAM is unknown; the observation of less frequent ectopic germinal center formation in HTLV-1-seropositive SS patients was a breakthrough. In addition, HTLV-1 infected cells inhibited B-lymphocyte activating factor or C-X-C motif chemokine 13 through direct contact with established follicular dendritic cell-like cells. These findings show that HTLV-1 is directly involved in the pathogenesis of SS.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'A highly oxidized form of a chitosan/dextran-based hydrogel (CD-100) containing 80% oxidized dextran aldehyde (DA-100) was developed as a post-operative aid, and found to significantly prevent adhesion formation in endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). However, the CD-100 hydrogel showed moderate in vitro cytotoxicity to mammalian cell lines, with the DA-100 found to be the cytotoxic component. In order to extend the use of the hydrogel to abdominal surgeries, reformulation using a lower oxidized DA (DA-25) was pursued. The aim of the present study was to compare the antimicrobial efficacy, in vitro biocompatibility and wound healing capacity of the highly oxidized CD-100 hydrogel with the CD-25 hydrogel. Antimicrobial studies were performed against a range of clinically relevant abdominal microorganisms using the micro-broth dilution method. Biocompatibility testing using human dermal fibroblasts was assessed via a tetrazolium reduction assay (MTT) and a wound healing model. In contrast to the original DA-100 formulation, DA-25 was found to be non-cytotoxic, and showed no overall impairment of cell migration, with wound closure occurring at 72 h. However, the lower oxidation level negatively affected the antimicrobial efficacy of the hydrogel (CD-25). Although the CD-25 hydrogel’s antimicrobial efficacy and anti-fibroblast activity is decreased when compared to the original CD-100 hydrogel formulation, previous in vivo studies show that the CD-25 hydrogel remains  an effective, biocompatible barrier agent in the prevention of postoperative adhesions.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Mobile edge computing (MEC) provides a promising approach to significantly reduce network operational cost and improve quality of service (QoS) of mobile users by pushing computation resources to the network edges, and enables a scalable Internet of Things (IoT) architecture for time-sensitive applications (e-healthcare, real-time monitoring, and so on.). However, the mobility of mobile users and the limited coverage of edge servers can result in significant network performance degradation, dramatic drop in QoS, and even interruption of ongoing edge services; therefore, it is difficult to ensure service continuity. Service migration has great potential to address the issues, which decides when or where these services are migrated following user mobility and the changes of demand. In this paper, two conceptions similar to service migration, i.e., live migration for data centers and handover in cellular networks, are first discussed. Next, the cutting-edge research efforts on service migration in MEC are reviewed, and a devisal of taxonomy based on various research directions for efficient service migration is presented. Subsequently, a summary of three technologies for hosting services on edge servers, i.e., virtual machine, container, and agent, is provided. At last, open research challenges in service migration are identified and discussed.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) mimetic peptide, D-4F, exhibits anti-atherogenic effects similar to high-density lipoprotein (HDL). However, it remains elusive whether D-4F and HDL share similar molecular mechanisms underlying anti-atherogenic effects and endothelial cell protections. We here compared the metabolic changes in endothelial cells induced by D-4F and HDL against oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), which may be of benefit to understanding the protective mechanisms of HDL and D-4F. Functional assays, including wound healing, transwell migration, and tube formation, were used to evaluate the pro-angiogenic effects of HDL and D-4F. NMR-based metabolomic analysis was employed to explore the protective mechanisms underlying HDL and D-4F. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was performed to assess metabolic profiles, and orthogonal PLS-DA (OPLS-DA) was carried out to identify characteristic metabolites. Moreover, significantly altered metabolic pathways were also analyzed. We found that ox-LDL impaired the migration and tube formation of endothelial cells. Metabolomic analysis showed that ox-LDL triggered oxidative stress, impaired glycolysis, and enhanced glycerophospholipid metabolism. Both HDL and D-4F improved the migration and angiogenesis of endothelial cells, alleviated oxidative stress, and ameliorated disordered glycolysis impaired by ox-LDL. Strikingly, HDL partially attenuated the disturbed glycerophospholipid metabolism, whereas D-4F did not show this effect. In summary, although D-4F shared the similar protective effects with HDL on the migration and angiogenesis of endothelial cells, it could not deduce the molecular mechanisms of HDL completely. Nevertheless, D-4F possesses the potentiality to be exploited as clinically applicable agent for endothelial cell protection and cardiovascular disease treatment.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Tumor angiogenesis plays a crucial role in colorectal cancer development. Dysregulation of the receptor for the advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) transmembrane signaling mediates inflammation, resulting in various cancers. However, the mechanism of the RAGE signaling pathway in modulating development of colorectal cancer has not been explored. In this study, an aptamer-based RAGE antagonist (Apt-RAGE) was used to inhibit interaction between RAGE and S100B, thus blocking downstream NFκB-mediated signal transduction. In vitro results showed that Apt-RAGE effectively inhibited S100B-dependent and S100B-independent RAGE/NFκB activation in colorectal HCT116 cancer cells, thus decreasing proliferation and migration of cells. Notably, expression and secretion of VEGF-A were inhibited, implying that Apt-RAGE can be used as an antiangiogenesis agent in tumor therapy. Moreover, Apt-RAGE inhibited tumor growth and microvasculature formation in colorectal tumor-bearing mice. Inhibition of angiogenesis by Apt-RAGE was positively correlated with suppression of the RAGE/NFκB/VEGF-A signaling. The findings of this study show that Apt-RAGE antagonist is a potential therapeutic agent for treatment of colorectal cancer.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The characteristic six-layered appearance of the neocortex arises from the correct positioning of pyramidal neurons during development and alterations in this process can cause intellectual disabilities and developmental delay. Malformations in cortical development arise when neurons either fail to migrate properly from the germinal zones or fail to cease migration in the correct laminar position within the cortical plate. The Reelin signalling pathway is vital for correct neuronal positioning as loss of Reelin leads to a partially inverted cortex. The precise biological function of Reelin remains controversial and debate surrounds its role as a chemoattractant or stop signal for migrating neurons. To investigate this further we developed an in silico agent-based model of cortical layer formation. Using this model we tested four biologically plausible hypotheses for neuron motility and four biologically plausible hypotheses for the loss of neuron motility (conversion from migration). A matrix of 16 combinations of motility and conversion rules was applied against the known structure of mouse cortical layers in the wild-type cortex, the Reelin-null mutant, the Dab1-null mutant and a conditional Dab1 mutant. Using this approach, many combinations of motility and conversion mechanisms can be rejected. For example, the model does not support Reelin acting as a repelling or as a stopping signal. In contrast, the study lends very strong support to the notion that the glycoprotein Reelin acts as a chemoattractant for neurons. Furthermore, the most viable proposition for the conversion mechanism is one in which conversion is affected by a motile neuron sensing in the near vicinity neurons that have already converted. Therefore, this model helps elucidate the function of Reelin during neuronal migration and cortical development.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Abstract Background In order to develop a new immunotherapeutic agent targeting metastatic breast cancers, we chose to utilize autocatalytic feature of the membrane serine protease Prss14/ST14, a specific prognosis marker for ER negative breast cancer as a target molecule. Methods The study was conducted using three mouse breast cancer models, 4\\u2009T1 and E0771 mouse breast cancer cells into their syngeneic hosts, and an MMTV-PyMT transgenic mouse strain was used. Prss14/ST14 knockdown cells were used to test function in tumor growth and metastasis, peptides derived from the autocatalytic loop for activation were tested as preventive metastasis vaccine, and monoclonal and humanized antibodies to the same epitope were tested as new therapeutic candidates. ELISA, immunoprecipitation, Immunofluorescent staining, and flow cytometry were used to examine antigen binding. The functions of antibodies were tested in vitro for cell migration and in vivo for tumor growth and metastasis. Results Prss14/ST14 is critically involved in the metastasis of breast cancer and poor survival rather than primary tumor growth in two mouse models. The epitopes derived from the specific autocatalytic loop region of Prss14/ST14, based on structural modeling acted as efficient preventive metastasis vaccines in mice. A new specific monoclonal antibody mAb3F3 generated against the engineered loop structure could reduce cell migration, eliminate metastasis in PyMT mice, and can detect the Prss14/ST14 protein expressed in various human cancer cells. Humanized antibody huAb3F3 maintained the specificity and reduced the migration of human breast cancer cells in vitro. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that Prss14/ST14 is an important target for modulating metastasis. Our newly developed hybridoma mAbs and humanized antibody can be further developed as new promising candidates for the use in diagnosis and in immunotherapy of human metastatic breast cancer.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'A biologically active agent based on a Zn-1,3,5-benzen tricarboxylic acid (Zn-BTC) framework incorporated into a chitosan (CS) biopolymer (Zn-BTC@CS) was successfully synthesized using a microwave irradiation technique. The synthesized Zn-BTC@CS was characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the obtained data indicated a highly smooth surface morphology of the synthesized Zn-BTC and no morphological changes when the Zn-BTC covered the CS. In addition, the particle size diameter varied from 20 to 40 nm. XRD displayed a well-maintained Zn-BTC structure, and the crystal structure of Zn-BTC was not distorted by the composition of Zn-BTC and chitosan in the nanocomposite. Data from BET analysis revealed that the specific surface area of the Zn-BTC was reduced from 995.15 m<sup>2</sup>/g to 15.16 m<sup>2</sup>/g after coating with chitosan. The pore size distribution and pore volume of the Zn-BTC, Zn-BTC@CS were centered at 37.26 nm and at 22.5 nm, respectively. Zn-BTC@CS exhibited anticancer efficacy against lung and colon cancer cell lines. Zn-BTC@CS inhibited the proliferation of A549 and DLD-1 cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 13.2 and 19.8 µg/mL for the colon and lung cancer cell lines, respectively. Zn-BTC@CS stimulated the apoptotic process through up-regulating P53 expression and down-regulating Bcl-2 expression. Moreover, Zn-BTC@CS induced in vitro DNA fragmentation in both cancer cell lines with significantly different affinity by 66% (A549) and 20% (DLD-1) versus 52% reduction by Cisplatin. Zn-BTC@CS (IC50) exhibited anti-invasive activity and dramatically inhibited the migration of lung and colon cancer cell lines. This study provides evidence that Zn-BTC@CS targets the essential proteins involved in proliferation, metastasis, and apoptosis. Thus, Zn-BTC@CS has chemotherapeutic potential for inhibiting lung and colon cancer viability and growth.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Immunological therapy of progressive tumors requires not only activation and expansion of tumor specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), but also an efficient effector phase including migration of CTLs in the tumor tissue followed by conjugation and killing of target cells. We report the application of an agent-based model to recapitulate both the effect of a specific immunotherapy strategy against B16-melanoma in mice and the tumor progression in a generic tissue section. A comparison of the in silico results with the in vivo experiments shows excellent agreement. We therefore use the model to predict a critical role for CD137 expression on tumor vessel endothelium for successful therapy and other mechanistic aspects. Experimental results are fully compatible with the model predictions. The biologically oriented in silico model derived in this work will be used to predict treatment failure or success in other pre-clinical conditions eventually leading new promising in vivo experiments.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Abstract Background Omega-9 fatty acids represent one of the main mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) found in plant and animal sources. They are synthesized endogenously in humans, though not fully compensating all body requirements. Consequently, they are considered as partially essential fatty acids. MUFA represent a healthier alternative to saturated animal fats and have several health benefits, including anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer characters. The main body of the abstract This review capitalizes on the major omega-9 pharmacological activities in context of inflammation management for its different natural forms in different dietary sources. The observed anti-inflammatory effects reported for oleic acid (OA), mead acid, and erucic acid were directed to attenuate inflammation in several physiological and pathological conditions such as wound healing and eye inflammation by altering the production of inflammatory mediators, modulating neutrophils infiltration, and altering VEGF effector pathway. OA action mechanisms as anti-tumor agent in different cancer types are compiled for the first time based on its anti- and pro-carcinogenic actions. Conclusion We conclude that several pathways are likely to explain the anti-proliferative activity of OA including suppression of migration and proliferation of breast cancer cells, as well stimulation of tumor suppressor genes. Such action mechanisms warrant for further supportive clinical and epidemiological studies to confirm the beneficial outcomes of omega-9 consumption especially over long-term intervention.',\n",

Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are small subpopulations of cells with capacities for drug resistance, self-renewal, recurrence, metastasis, and differentiation.

The purified compound was identified as betavulgarin, using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry.

This compound decreased the total level and phosphorylated nuclear level of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) and reduced the mRNA and protein levels of sex determining region Y (SRY)-box 2 (SOX2), in mammospheres. These data suggest that betavulgarin inhibit the Stat3/Sox2 signaling pathway and induces BCSC death, indicating betavulgarin might be an anticancer agent against breast cancer cells and BCSCs.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) stands out among polymers as a promising biomaterial due to its mechanical strength, hydrophilicity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, low toxicity and renewability. The use of scaffolds based on BNC for 3D cell culture has been previously demonstrated. The study exploited excellent properties of the BNC to develop an efficient and low-cost in vitro cell migration assay. The BNC scaffold was introduced into a cell culture 24 h after the SW480 cells were seeded, and cells were allowed to enter the scaffold within the next 24–48 h. The cells were stained with different fluorophores either before or after the introduction of the scaffold in the culture. Untreated cells were observed to enter the BNC scaffold in significant numbers, form clusters and retain a high viability after 48 h. To validate the assay’s usability for drug development, the treatments of SW480 cells were performed using aspirin, an agent known to reduce the migratory potential of this cell line in culture. This study demonstrates the application of BNC as a scaffold for cell migration testing as a low-cost alternative to commercial assays based on the Boyden chamber principle. The assay could be further developed for routine use in cancer research and anticancer drug development.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Cells assemble numerous types of actomyosin bundles that generate contractile forces for biological processes, such as cytokinesis and cell migration. One example of contractile bundles is a transverse arc that forms via actomyosin-driven condensation of actin filaments in the lamellipodia of migrating cells and exerts significant forces on the surrounding environments. Structural reorganization of a network into a bundle facilitated by actomyosin contractility is a physiologically relevant and biophysically interesting process. Nevertheless, it remains elusive how actin filaments are reoriented, buckled, and bundled as well as undergo tension buildup during the structural reorganization. In this study, using an agent-based computational model, we demonstrated how the interplay between the density of myosin motors and cross-linking proteins and the rigidity, initial orientation, and turnover of actin filaments regulates the morphological transformation of a cross-linked actomyosin network into a bundle and the buildup of tension occurring during the transformation.',\n",

This phenolic compound is safe even at high doses. However, it has poor bioavailability. The incidence rates of endometrial cancer (EC) that is one of the most prevalent gynecological malignancies is increasing. Meanwhile, the onset age of EC has been decreased in past few years. Besides, EC does not show a convenient prognosis, particularly at advanced stages. Based on this information, discovering new approaches or enhancing the available ones is required to provide better care for EC patients. In this review, we cover studies concerned with the anti-tumor effects of curcumin on EC. We focus on molecular mechanisms that are targeted by curcumin treatment in different processes of cancer development and progression, such as apoptosis, inflammation, and migration. Furthermore, we present the role of curcumin in targeting some microRNAs (miRNAs) that may play a role in EC.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'This paper aims to investigate the fundamental requirements for a cloud-based scheduling service for manufacturing, notably manufacturer priority to scheduling service, resolution of schedule conflict, and error-proof data entry. A flow chart of an inference-based system for manufacturing scheduling is proposed and a prototype was designed using semantic web technologies. An adapted version of the Muth and Thompson 10\\xa0×\\xa010 scheduling problem (MT10) was used as a case study and two manufacturing companies represented our use cases. Using Microsoft Project, levelled manufacturer operation plans were generated. Semantic rules were proposed for constraints calculation, scheduling and verification. Pellet semantic reasoner was used to apply those rules onto the case study. The results include two main findings. First, our system effectively detected conflicts when subjected to four types of disturbances. Secondly, suggestions of conflict resolutions were effective when implemented albeit they were not efficient. Consequently, our two hypotheses were accepted which gave merit for future works intended to develop scheduling as a web service. Future works will include three phases: (1) migration of our system to a graph database server, (2) a multi-agent system to automate conflict resolution and data entry, and (3) an optimisation mechanism for manufacturer prioritisation to scheduling services.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Targeting metastasis is a vital strategy to improve the clinical outcome of cancer patients, specifically in cases with high-grade malignancies. Here, we employed a <i>Salmonella</i>-based treatment to address metastasis. The potential of <i>Salmonella</i> as an anticancer agent has been extensively studied; however, the mechanism through which it affects metastasis remains unclear. This study found that the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) inducer SNAI1 was markedly reduced in <i>Salmonella</i>-treated melanoma cells, as revealed by immunoblotting. Furthermore, wound healing and transwell assays showed a reduced in vitro cell migration following <i>Salmonella</i> treatment. Transfection experiments confirmed that <i>Salmonella</i> acted against metastasis by suppressing protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, which in turn inhibited SNAI1 expression. Since it is known that metastasis is also influenced by inflammation, we partly characterized the immune infiltrates in melanoma as affected by <i>Salmonella</i> treatment. We found through tumor-macrophage co-culture that <i>Salmonella</i> treatment increased high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) secretion in tumors to coax the polarization of macrophages in favor of an M1-like phenotype, as shown by increased inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and Interleukin 1 Beta (IL-1<i>β</i>) secretion. Data from our animal study corroborated the in vitro findings, wherein the <i>Salmonella</i>-treated group obtained the lowest lung metastases, longer survival, and increased iNOS-expressing immune infiltrates.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The increasing attractiveness of Luxembourg as a place to work and live\\r\\nputs its land use and transport systems under high pressure. Understanding how the country can accommodate residential growth and additional traffic in a sustainable manner is a key and difficult challenge that requires a policy relevant, flexible and responsive modelling framework. We describe the first fully-fletched land use and transport interaction framework (MOEBIUS) applied to the whole of Luxembourg. We stress its multi-scalar nature and detail the articulation of two of its main components: a dynamic demographic microsimulation at the scale of individuals and a micro-spatial scale simulation of residential choice. Conversely to traditional zone-based approaches, the framework keeps full details of households and individuals for residential and travel mode choice, making the model highly consistent with theory. In addition, results and policy constraints are implemented at a very fine resolution (20m) and can thus incorporate local effects (residential externalities, local urban design). Conversely to fully disaggregated approaches, a linkage is organized at an intermediate scale, which allows (i) to simplify the generation and spatial distribution of trips, (ii) to parallelise parts of the residential choice simulation, and (iii) to ensure a good calibration of the population and real estate market estimates. We show model outputs for different scenarios at the horizon 2030 and compare them along sustainability criteria.',\n",

In vitro analyses on the proliferation, migration/invasion, cell cycle and apoptosis were performed on ACAE-treated non-small cell lung cancer cells, H441GL and control CGL1 cells. In vivo, immune-deficient mice were inoculated subcutaneously with H441GL followed by oral gavages of ACAE. The effect of ACAE on tumor progression was monitored by non-invasive bioluminescence imaging. The proliferation and migration/invasion of H441GL cells were inhibited by ACAE in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, ACAE induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and apoptosis in H441GL cells as shown by flow cytometric analysis, Annexin-V immunoflourescence and DNA fragmentation. In vivo bioluminescence imaging revealed that tumorigenesis was significantly retarded by oral treatment of ACAE in a dose-dependent fashion. Based on our experimental data, ACAE contains anti-cancer properties and could be considered as a potential CAM agent in future clinical evaluation.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Abstract Tubastatin A (Tub-A), a highly selective histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibitor, has been widely used as a cytotoxic anticancer agent, or for the treatment of patients with asthma. However, the potential toxicity of Tub-A on oocyte maturation and asymmetric division is still unclear. Therefore, the present study was designed to examine the effect and potential regulatory role of Tub-A on the meiotic maturation of oocytes. We observed that Tub-A treatment induced an increased level of the acetylation of α-tubulin, and a failure of spindle migration and actin cap formation. Based on the spindle structure, most Tub-A treated oocytes were arrested in an MI-like or a GVBD-like stage and exhibited decondensed chromosomes in a dose dependent manner. Moreover, Tub-A treatment decreased the protein expression of mTOR, a factor responsible for spindle formation, and the expression of mDia1, an inhibitor of actin assembly, in an HDAC6 expression-dependent manner. Importantly, following Tub-A supplementation, most oocytes failed to extrude the first polar body, which indicates that these defects are closely linked to abnormal oocyte maturation. Taken together, our data demonstrates that HDAC6 is one of the essential factors for oocyte maturation and asymmetric division via the HDAC6/mTOR or mDia1 pathway in mice.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Despite its prominent therapeutic efficacy, chemotherapy has raised serious concerns due to the severe adverse effects and multidrug resistance evoked, which propels the search for safe and green therapeutic agents. BAMLET (bovine α-lactalbumin made lethal against tumor cell) is a well-known protein-based anticancer agent of selective tumoricidal activity. Here, we prepared oleic acid-modified mesoporous silica nanoparticles (OA-MSNs) conjugated with bovine α-lactalbumin, a lipoprotein complex resembling BAMLET formed on the surface of MSNs (MSN-BAMLET) to load the anticancer drug of docetaxel (DTX). Compared to that of OA-MSNs/DTX, the obtained MSN-BAMLET/DTX with a sustained and pH-responsive drug release behaviors exhibited good biocompatibility and enhanced cytotoxic effect against cancer cells. Moreover, the presence of lipoprotein complex in MSN-BAMLET contributed to the improved dispersion of the composite in solution and the inhibitory effect on the migration of cancer cells. Furthermore, the adsorption profiles of protein corona on the obtained nanoparticles were analyzed. It was found that the marked low amount and abundance of plasma proteins were adsorbed on the α-lactalbumin coated siliceous composite demonstrated its long circulation property. Finally, in vivo study showed that MSN-BAMLET/DTX contributed to the effective cancer ablation and the prolonged survival. Therefore, the constructed MSN-BAMLET of the mesoregular structure and peculiar tumoricidal effect provides a manipulable nanoplatform as drug nanocarrier for therapeutic applications.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Mobile edge computing is a new computing model, which pushes cloud computing power from centralized cloud to network edge. However, with the sinking of computing power, user mobility brings new challenges: since it is usually unstable, services should be dynamically migrated between multiple edge servers to maintain service performance, that is, user-perceived latency. Considering that Mobile Edge Computing is a highly distributed computing environment and it is difficult to synchronize information between servers, in order to ensure the real-time performance of the migration strategy, a virtual machine migration strategy based on Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning is proposed in this paper. The method of centralized training and distributed execution is adopted, that is, the transfer action is guided by the global information during training, and only the local observation information is needed to obtain the transfer action. Compared with the centralized control method, the proposed method alleviates communication bottleneck. Compared with other distributed control methods, this method only needs local information, does not need communication between servers, and speeds up the perception of the current environment. Migration strategies can be generated faster. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy is better than the contrast strategy in terms of convergence and energy consumption.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Background/Aims: Nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) is one of the common human malignant diseases all over the world, and chemotherapy remains the main therapy for NPC. However, the survival and life quality of NPC patients are still very poor. Thus, novel and selective anti-tumor agents are pressingly needed. Our previous study identified pectolinarigenin as a novel effective anti-tumor drug candidate for NPC. In this study, we further investigated its anti-tumor activities and explored the potential molecular mechanism. Methods: NPC C666-1 cells were cultured and treated by pectolinarigenin. Cell proliferation assay, colony formation assay, Transwell assay and wound healing assay were conducted and cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. Mitochondrial transmembrane potential and ROS were also observed. NPC subcutaneous xenograft mice model was established to evaluate the anti-tumor effect of pectolinarigenin in vivo. Results: We observed that treatment of pectolinarigenin inhibited cell viability and cell migration of NPC C666-1 cells in concentration- and time-dependent manner. Pectolinarigenin induced cell apoptosis in C666-1 cells detected by flow cytometry analysis, which was associated with the activation of mitochondrial-related apoptosis and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Pectolinarigenin also activated caspase signaling pathway. The in vivo experiment of subcutaneous xenograft mice model also indicated that the administration of pectolinarigenin could decrease the tumor growth of NPC and no severe toxicity was observed. Conclusions: Based on our findings, we conclude that pectolinarigenin could suppress the tumor growth of NPC, which verifies it as a new therapeutic agent for treating this devastating disease.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"<h4>Background</h4>Targeting angiogenesis has emerged as an attractive and promising strategy in anti-cancer therapeutic development. The present study investigates the anti-angiogenic potential of Panduratin A (PA), a natural chalcone isolated from Boesenbergia rotunda by using both in vitro and in vivo assays.<h4>Methodology/principal findings</h4>PA exerted selective cytotoxicity on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with IC(50) value of 6.91 ± 0.85 µM when compared to human normal fibroblast and normal liver epithelial cells. Assessment of the growth kinetics by cell impedance-based Real-Time Cell Analyzer showed that PA induced both cytotoxic and cytostatic effects on HUVECs, depending on the concentration used. Results also showed that PA suppressed VEGF-induced survival and proliferation of HUVECs. Furthermore, endothelial cell migration, invasion, and morphogenesis or tube formation demonstrated significant time- and dose-dependent inhibition by PA. PA also suppressed matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) secretion and attenuated its activation to intermediate and active MMP-2. In addition, PA suppressed F-actin stress fiber formation to prevent migration of the endothelial cells. More importantly, anti-angiogenic potential of PA was also evidenced in two in vivo models. PA inhibited neo-vessels formation in murine Matrigel plugs, and angiogenesis in zebrafish embryos.<h4>Conclusions/significance</h4>Taken together, our study demonstrated the distinctive anti-angiogenic properties of PA, both in vitro and in vivo. This report thus reveals another biological activity of PA in addition to its reported anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities, suggestive of PA's potential for development as an anti-angiogenic agent for cancer therapy.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Compared with primary and local tumor, metastasis is more difficult to resect completely and remain the leading cause of death associated with solid tumors. It is therefore pressing to develop effective strategies to prevent and suppress tumor metastasis in its early stages. Heparanase overexpression is significantly associated with increased malignancy and metastasis. Here, we develop a novel heparanase degradable heparin-based microcarrier, HBMA, for specific staining, targeting, and inhibiting tumor cells with high metastatic potential. HBMA is fabricated through self-assembling of three components, positively charged fluorescent gold nanoclusters (KG-AuNCs), heparin polymers (HP), and antisense miRNA-21 oligonucleotides (AM-21), with each component playing multiple roles. Results of confocal microscopy and flow cytometry show that this agent has an excellent capability to label metastatic tumor cells with high selectivity. On the therapeutic side, the results of cell viability assay, wound healing assay, and plate colony formation assay verify that HBMA induces a significant inhibition effect towards the proliferation and migration of the selectively target tumor cells. The heparanase responsive AM-21 delivery, the specific staining, and the efficient tumor cell activity suppression highlight HBMA as a promising cancer theranostic agent to prevent tumor metastasis.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Gastroretentive raft-forming formulations were developed in liquid and chewable tablet dosage forms to achieve prolonged delivery of quercetin in the stomach. The formulations contained a solid dispersion of quercetin and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP K 30) at a 1:10 w/w ratio to improve the solubility of the flavonoid. The formulations also contained sodium alginate as a gel forming agent, calcium carbonate as a calcium source and carbon dioxide producer and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose K100M as a drug release retarding polymer. The chewable tablets incorporated mannitol as a diluent. Both liquid and chewable tablet formulations exhibited rapid floating behaviour (lag time\\xa0<\\xa01\\xa0min) and long floating duration (>24\\xa0h) in 0.1\\xa0N HCl. The optimized liquid formulation showed superior characteristics based on high raft strength (10.4\\xa0g) and sustained release of quercetin (93 % over 8\\xa0h) whereas the optimized chewable tablet formulation exhibited lower raft strength (7.2\\xa0g) and lower drug release (79 % in 8\\xa0h). The optimized liquid and chewable tablet formulations were found to induce anti-inflammatory activity in cell culture using RAW 264.7 cells macrophages and enhance the migration of human gastric adenocarcinoma (AGS) epithelial cells in vitro, indicating wound healing potential for treatment of gastric ulcers.',\n",

The results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and <sup>13</sup>C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) showed that PDTBP was successfully synthesized. Compared with the traditional intumescent flame retardant (IFR) system contained APP and pentaerythritol (PER), the novel IFR system (APP/PDTBP, weight ratio of 2:1) could significantly promote the flame retardancy, water resistance, and thermal stability of HDPE. The HDPE/APP/PDTBP composites (PE3) could achieve a UL-94 V-0 rating with LOI value of 30.8%, and had a lower migration percentage (2.2%). However, the HDPE/APP/PER composites (PE5) had the highest migration percentage (4.7%), lower LOI value of 23.9%, and could only achieve a UL-94 V-1 rating. Besides, the peak of heat release rate (PHRR), total heat release (THR), and fire hazard value of PE3 were markedly decreased compared to PE5. PE3 had higher tensile strength and flexural strength of 16.27 &#177; 0.42 MPa and 32.03 &#177; 0.59 MPa, respectively. Furthermore, the possible flame-retardant mechanism of the APP/PDTBP IFR system indicated that compact and continuous intumescent char layer would be formed during burning, thus inhibiting the degradation of substrate material and improving the thermal stability of HDPE.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The cestode Echinococcus multilocularis is the causative agent of a severe zoonotic disease: alveolar echinococcosis (AE). The parasite is distributed over a vast area in northern Eurasia and North America, but the impact of AE on human health is highly uneven between different regions. One hypothetical reason for this difference in virulence may be the genetic structure of E. multilocularis which—based on mitochondrial sequences and EmsB microsatellite profiles—forms four distinct clades. These clades correspond approximately to their continents of origin: Asia, Europe, and North America, with a fourth clade apparently restricted to Mongolia and neighboring regions, even though this clade has not yet been described by EmsB genotyping. However, there are various records of genetic variants from the “wrong” region, e.g., “European” haplotypes in Western Canada, which may be the result of introduction or natural migration of host animals. One such example, prompting this study, is the recent record of an “Asian” mitochondrial haplotype in worms from foxes in Poland. At the time, this could not be confirmed by EmsB microsatellite analysis, a method that has proven to possess greater discriminatory power with the E. multilocularis nuclear genome than sequencing of mitochondrial markers. Therefore, worms collected from foxes in Poland were examined both by EmsB analysis and sequencing of the full mitochondrial cox1 gene in order to allocate the samples to the European or Asian cluster. Based on EmsB analyses of 349 worms from 97 Polish red foxes, 92% of the worms clearly showed “European-type” EmsB profiles, but 27 worms (8%) from seven foxes showed profiles that clustered with samples of Asian origin. According to cox1 sequences, a total of 18 worms from 8 foxes belonged to the Asian cluster of haplotypes. The two methods did not fully agree: only 13 worms from three foxes belonged to Asian clusters by both EmsB and cox1, whereas 18 worms from nine foxes belonged to different clusters, according to each marker. Cross-fertilization between worms of Asian origin and those from the European Polish population may explain these conflicting results. The presence of clearly Asian elements in the Polish E. multilocularis population could be the result of introduction of E. multilocularis with host animals (e.g., domestic dogs), or the migration of foxes. In the absence of genetic data from eastern European countries, especially those bordering Poland, it cannot be concluded whether this Asian admixture is typical for a larger area toward central/eastern Europe, or the Polish parasite population is the western extreme of a gradient where both European and Asian elements mingle. Further studies are needed on this subject, preferably using both mitochondrial sequencing and EmsB microsatellite analysis.',\n",

Previous studies have identified Kae as a possible cancer preventive and therapeutic agent. We found Kae to exhibit potent antiproliferation and anti-migration effects in human bladder cancer EJ cells. Kaempferol robustly induced apoptosis in EJ cells in a dose-dependent manner, as evidenced by increased cleavage of caspase-3. Furthermore, we found Kae-induced apoptosis in EJ cells to be associated with phosphatase and the tensin homolog deleted on the chromosome 10 (PTEN)/PI3K/Akt pathway. Kae significantly increased PTEN and decreased Akt phosphorylation. Kae-induced apoptosis was partially attenuated in PTEN-knockdown cells. Our findings indicate that Kae could be an alternative medicine for bladder cancer, based on a PTEN activation mechanism.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-7 is a member of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta superfamily, which is originally identified based on its ability to induce cartilage and bone formation. In recent years, BMP-7 is also defined as a potent promoter of cell motility, invasion, and metastasis. However, there is little knowledge of the role of BMP-7 and its cellular function in chondrosarcoma cells. In the present study, we investigated the biological impact of BMP-7 on cell motility using transwell assay. In addition, the intracellular signaling pathways were also investigated by pharmacological and genetic approaches. Our results demonstrated that treatment with exogenous BMP-7 markedly increased cell migration by activating c-Src/PI3K/Akt/IKK/NF-κB signaling pathway, resulting in the transactivation of αvβ3 integrin expression. Indeed, abrogation of signaling activation, by chemical inhibition or expression of a kinase dead form of the protein attenuated BMP-7-induced expression of integrin αvβ3 and cell migration. These findings may provide a useful tool for diagnostic/prognostic purposes and even therapeutically in late-stage chondrosarcoma as an anti-metastatic agent.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'To conduct experiments related to the facilitated extraction phenomenon of vanadium ions (VO2+), three supported liquid membranes (SLMs) were prepared, each containing 0.01\\u2009M of methyl cholate (MC), resorcinarene (RESO), or trioctylamine (TOA) as extractive agents. Kinetic and thermodynamic models were developed, based on the interaction of the substrate (VO2+) with the extractive agent T and the diffusion of the formed entity (TS) through the membrane. The experimental results verify the models, and to determine, macroscopic parameters, permeabilities (P) and initial fluxes (J0), and microscopic parameters, association constants (Kass) and apparent diffusion coefficients (D⁎) related to formed entities (TS) and their diffusion through the membrane organic phase. The experimental results indicate that the mechanism on the migration of the VO2+ ions through the membrane organic phase is based on the successive jumps of substrate, from one site to another of the extractive agent. To explain these results and understand the mechanism, we studied influence of temperature factor, and we determined activation parameters (Ea, ΔH≠, and ΔS≠). The results show that this extraction phenomenon is governed by a structural term. Therefore, the membrane performance changes according to nature and structure of the association site presented by each of extractive agents.',\n",

Polymer and cell constructs are under research to create tissue that replaces the affected area in cardiac tissue after myocardial infarction (MI). The aim of the present study is to evaluate the behavior of differentiated and undifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in vitro and in silico and to compare the results that both offer when it comes to the design process of biodevices for the treatment of infarcted myocardium in biomodels. To assess in vitro behavior, MSCs are isolated from rat bone marrow and seeded undifferentiated and differentiated in multiple scaffolds of a gelled biomaterial. Subsequently, cell behavior is evaluated by trypan blue and fluorescence microscopy, which showed that the cells presented high viability and low cell migration in the biomaterial. An agent-based model intended to reproduce as closely as possible the behavior of individual MSCs by simulating cellular-level processes was developed, where the in vitro results are used to identify parameters in the agent-based model that is developed, and which simulates cellular-level processes: Apoptosis, differentiation, proliferation, and migration. Thanks to the results obtained, suggestions for good results in the design and fabrication of the proposed scaffolds and how an agent-based model can be helpful for testing hypothesis are presented in the discussion. It is concluded that assessment of cell behavior through the observation of viability, proliferation, migration, inflammation reduction, and spatial composition in vitro and in silico, represents an appropriate strategy for scaffold engineering.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Background: Baohuoside-1 is a flavonoid compound isolated from Epimedium koreanum Nakai. This study tried to systematically explore the potential anti-cancer functions of Baohuoside-1 in Hepatocellular Carcinoma and study related molecular mechanism. Moreover, as a potential candidate anti-cancer agent, Baohuoside-1 has relatively low toxic side effect.Methods: The anti-cancer function including proliferation, invasion and migration of Baohuoside-1 in liver cancer was systematically assessed via colony formation, transwell assay and migration assay. Moreover, the anti-cancer functions of Baohuoside-1 was confirmed based on the nude mouse transplantation tumor experiment. The potential targeted signaling pathway was tested via flow cytometery and western blot analysis. Results: In this study, we present the anti-HCC activity of Baohuoside-1 isolated from Epimedium through examing the effect of Baohuoside-1 on two different human liver cancer cell lines (HuH-7 and HepG2). Baohuoside-1 significantly inhibited the proliferation, invasion and migration of two liver cancer cell lines. Furthermore, the anticancer activity of Baohuoside-1 was confirmed via inhibiting liver tumor growth in nude mice in vivo. Additionally, the influence of Baohuoside-1 on liver cancer apoptosis was examined by analyzing the expression of pro/anti-apoptotic proteins (BAX, Bcl-2, caspase-3, and caspase-8). The potential targeting signaling of Baohuoside-1 was determined via testing key members’ expression changes of mTOR and JAK2 signaling. Conclusion: The inhibition of liver cancer by Baohuoside-1 is through targeting mTOR signaling not JAK2 signaling to induce apoptosis. Our study indicates that Baohuoside-1 is a potential candidate drug for therapy against liver cancer.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Abstract Background Vascular maturity and functionality are closely associated with tumor progression and chemosensitivity. The antidiabetic agent metformin has shown its ability to inhibit tumor angiogenesis in metastatic breast cancer models. However, it remains unclear if or how metformin remodels the abnormal vasculature of metastatic breast cancer, while inhibiting angiogenesis. Methods Metastatic breast cancer models were constructed to compare microvessel density (MVD), vascular maturity and function, lung metastasis and chemosensitivity in metformin-treated or untreated mice. Protein array assay and transcriptome sequencing were performed for genetic screening. Lentiviral shRNA-PDGF-B transfection was used for observing the contribution of PDGF-B knockdown to metformin’s vascular effects. Results Metastatic breast cancers were characterized by an excessively angiogenic, immature and morphologically abnormal vasculature. Compared to control, metformin significantly reduced MVD, leakage and hypoxia, and increased vascular mural cells coverage and perfusion, namely, “vessel normalization”. Metformin at human blood concentrations had no direct effect on the migration and proliferation of cancer cells. Based on that, reduced lung metastasis of the primary tumor and improved chemosensitization by metformin were assumed to be mediated via metformin’s vascular effects. Further results of genetic screening and in vivo experiments showed that the downregulation of platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF-B) greatly contributed to the metformin-induced vessel normalization. Conclusions These findings provide pre-clinical evidences for the vascular mechanism of metformin-induced metastasis inhibition and the chemosensitization of metastatic breast cancers.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death among females worldwide. A major challenge is to develop innovative therapy in order to treat breast cancer subtypes resistant to current treatment. In the present study, we examined the effects of two Troglitazone derivatives Δ2-TGZ and AB186. Previous studies showed that both compounds induce apoptosis, nevertheless AB186 was a more potent agent. The kinetic of cellular events was investigated by real-time cell analysis system (RTCA) in MCF-7 (hormone dependent) and MDA-MB-231 (triple negative) breast cancer (TNBC) cells, followed by cell morphology analysis by immuno-localization. Both compounds induced a rapid modification of both impedance-based signals and cellular morphology. This process was associated with an inhibition of cell migration measured by wound healing and transwell assays in TNBC MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells. In order to identify cytoplasmic targets of AB186, we performed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and pull-down analyses. Subsequently, 6 cytoskeleton components were identified as potential targets. We further validated α-tubulin as one of the direct targets of AB186. In conclusion, our results suggested that AB186 could be promising to develop novel therapeutic strategies to treat aggressive forms of breast cancer such as TNBC.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Vascular abnormalities contribute to many diseases such as cancer and diabetic retinopathy. In angiogenesis new blood vessels, headed by a migrating tip cell, sprout from pre-existing vessels in response to signals, e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Tip cells meet and fuse (anastomosis) to form blood-flow supporting loops. Tip cell selection is achieved by Dll4-Notch mediated lateral inhibition resulting, under normal conditions, in an interleaved arrangement of tip and non-migrating stalk cells. Previously, we showed that the increased VEGF levels found in many diseases can cause the delayed negative feedback of lateral inhibition to produce abnormal oscillations of tip/stalk cell fates. Here we describe the development and implementation of a novel physics-based hierarchical agent model, tightly coupled to in vivo data, to explore the system dynamics as perpetual lateral inhibition combines with tip cell migration and fusion. We explore the tipping point between normal and abnormal sprouting as VEGF increases. A novel filopodia-adhesion driven migration mechanism is presented and validated against in vivo data. Due to the unique feature of ongoing lateral inhibition, 'stabilised' tip/stalk cell patterns show sensitivity to the formation of new cell-cell junctions during fusion: we predict cell fates can reverse. The fusing tip cells become inhibited and neighbouring stalk cells flip fate, recursively providing new tip cells. Junction size emerges as a key factor in establishing a stable tip/stalk pattern. Cell-cell junctions elongate as tip cells migrate, which is shown to provide positive feedback to lateral inhibition, causing it to be more susceptible to pathological oscillations. Importantly, down-regulation of the migratory pathway alone is shown to be sufficient to rescue the sprouting system from oscillation and restore stability. Thus we suggest the use of migration inhibitors as therapeutic agents for vascular normalisation in cancer.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Despite numerous technology advances, bioreactors are still mostly utilized as functional black-boxes where trial and error eventually leads to the desirable cellular outcome. Investigators have applied various computational approaches to understand the impact the internal dynamics of such devices has on overall cell growth, but such models cannot provide a comprehensive perspective regarding the system dynamics, due to limitations inherent to the underlying approaches. In this study, a novel multi-paradigm modeling platform capable of simulating the dynamic bidirectional relationship between cells and their microenvironment is presented. Designing the modeling platform entailed combining and coupling fully an agent-based modeling platform with a transport phenomena computational modeling framework. To demonstrate capability, the platform was used to study the impact of bioreactor parameters on the overall cell population behavior and vice versa. In order to achieve this, virtual bioreactors were constructed and seeded. The virtual cells, guided by a set of rules involving the simulated mass transport inside the bioreactor, as well as cell-related probabilistic parameters, were capable of displaying an array of behaviors such as proliferation, migration, chemotaxis and apoptosis. In this way the platform was shown to capture not only the impact of bioreactor transport processes on cellular behavior but also the influence that cellular activity wields on that very same local mass transport, thereby influencing overall cell growth. The platform was validated by simulating cellular chemotaxis in a virtual direct visualization chamber and comparing the simulation with its experimental analogue. The results presented in this paper are in agreement with published models of similar flavor. The modeling platform can be used as a concept selection tool to optimize bioreactor design specifications.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Rotavirus remains the main causative agent of gastroenteritis in young children, in countries that have not yet introduced the vaccine. Benin, in order to implement the WHO recommendations, projects to introduce the rotavirus vaccine in 2018 as part of its Expanded Program on Immunization. But before the introduction of this vaccine, epidemiological data on rotavirus infections and rotavirus genotypes circulating in Benin should be available. The aim of this study is to generate epidemiological data on infantile rotavirus diarrhea in Benin. In order to determine the epidemiological characteristics and electrophoretypes of rotavirus responsible for gastroenteritis in diarrheic children aged 0 to 5 years, 186 stool samples were collected according to the WHO Rotavirus Laboratory Manual from March 2014 to February 2015 at Suru-Lere University Hospital Center. Detection of rotavirus antigen was performed by the ELISA test, followed by molecular characterization using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 186 stool samples were analyzed for rotavirus, and seventy-three (39.2%) were found to be positive for rotavirus antigen by ELISA. Children aged 3 to 24 months were the most affected by rotavirus diarrhea in this study. Of the seventy-three children affected with rotavirus diarrhea, 27 (37%) had vomiting accompanied by dehydration and fever. Results based on electrophoresis showed that, among the 73 samples tested, 38 yielded typical rotavirus electrophoretic migration profiles.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Design has transitioned progressively from a consumer-focused discipline to a human-centred one, with a more complex agenda. Design thinking has been successfully deployed as an agent for social change. In this paper we take a trans-disciplinary approach to social design in remote villages of Uttarakhand, India. Lack of employment opportunities and tough sustenance in the mountainous regions of India has led to mass migration and ghost villages. Recent interventions at the micro level, born from a participatory approach rather than the top down structure of government development schemes, have been seen to be more effective in tackling this complex socio-economic issue. Community based participatory research has been deployed previously in areas like public health and primary education successfully. With this paper we reflect on the viability of using it to identify areas of effective design intervention, not just to address current issues faced by the residents of remote villages in the Himalayas but also to encourage future social entrepreneurs. We worked in a group of Himalayan villages in collaboration with local government agents as part of a month long design education module. Design students and development professionals teamed up with residents, using methods like transect walks, socio-cultural mapping of health, water and sanitation, education, leadership, mobility, skill and vulnerability and co-design activities. Analysis led to a deeper understanding of social structure, education, resource equity, power dynamics, flow of information, drudgery, vulnerability and potential areas for social entrepreneurs. An iterative model of exploration, analysis, design proposition and refinement was followed to identify challenges faced by residents and areas of possible design intervention.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Tracking and detecting multiple objects is difficult for a single radar device, as it may not have the capacities such as anti-interference and anti-stealth. However, if radar devices of diverse capabilities can be combined to realize collaborative networked operation, the reliability and performance of a radar system in a complex environment can be significantly improved. This paper classify the networked radar-based multi-objective task planning as a combinatorial optimization problem with constraints and abstract a distributed multi-agent system (MAS) model from a networked radar system. A node-selection algorithm was designed based on a greedy policy to narrow down solution space for subsequent networked radar task planning, reduce the amount of calculation, and improve the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, focusing on NSGA-II, the proposed algorithm was modified using self-adaptive operators and reinforcement learning. A dual-population strategy was introduced to allow exchanges of multiple individuals between populations during migration, and the number of individuals for the exchange was obtained through reinforcement learning. In this paper, five algorithms are compared and analyzed. In addition, statistical analyses are conducted from four perspectives: the average evaluation value of energy consumption and bandwidth in the Pareto front solutions, the time consumption of the algorithm, and the diversity of the population. The results indicate that among those algorithms, the reinforcement-learning-based RNSGA-II algorithm can produce the best outcomes for networked radar task planning.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'European eel populations have declined markedly in recent decades, caused in part by in-stream barriers, such as weirs and pumping stations, which disrupt the upstream migration of juvenile eels, or elvers, into rivers. Eel passes, narrow sloping channels lined with substrata that enable elvers to ascend, are one way to mitigate against these barriers. Currently, studded eel tiles are a popular substrate. This study is the first to evaluate the flow fields within studded eel tiles and to model the swimming performance of elvers using cellular automata (CA) and individual- (or agent-) based models. Velocities and flow depths predicted by a computational fluid dynamics model of studded eel tiles are first validated against published values for a single installation angle–discharge combination. The validated model is then used to compute three-dimensional flow fields for eel passes at five different installation angles and three inflow discharges. CA and individual-based models are employed to assess upstream passage efficiency for a range of elver sizes. The individual-based model approximates measured passage efficiencies better than the CA model. Passage efficiency is greatest for shallow slopes, low discharges and large elvers. Results are synthesized into an easy-to-understand graphic to help practitioners improve eel pass designs.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Abstract Advances in medical imaging technologies now allow noninvasive image acquisition from individual patients at high spatiotemporal resolutions. A relatively new effort of predictive oncology is to develop a paradigm for forecasting the future status of an individual tumor given initial conditions and an appropriate mathematical model. The objective of this study was to introduce a comprehensive multiscale computational method to predict cancer and microvascular network growth patterns. A rectangular lattice-based model was designed so different evolutionary scenarios could be simulated and for predicting the impact of diffusible factors on tumor morphology and size. Further, the model allows prediction-based simulation of cell and microvascular behavior. Like a single cell, each agent is fully realized within the model and interactions are governed in part by machine learning methods. This multiscale computational model was developed and incorporated input information from in vivo microscale computed tomography (microCT) images acquired from breast cancer-bearing mice. It was found that as the difference between expansion of the cancer cell population and microvascular network increases, cells undergo proliferation and migration with a greater probability compared to other phenotypes. Overall, multiscale computational model agreed with both theoretical expectations and experimental findings (microCT images) not used during model training.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Raja GR Edula, Michael F PiccoMayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida, USAAbstract: Treatment options for Crohn&amp;rsquo;s disease have evolved beyond the early goals of induction and remission and are now more focused on preventing complications by altering the natural history of the disease. The advent of biologic therapies has revolutionized the management of Crohn&amp;rsquo;s disease. Specifically, antibodies to tumor necrosis factor alpha induce rapid mucosal healing. This translates into improved patient outcomes. However, many patients will fail these and other therapies. Natalizumab is a new biologic agent that has been approved for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn&amp;rsquo;s disease in patients who have failed or are intolerant to immunosuppressants and/or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors. It is a selective adhesion molecule inhibitor to alpha-4 integrin resulting in inhibition of the migration of inflammatory cells across the endothelium. This unique mechanism of action has been shown to be effective in the treatment of Crohn&amp;rsquo;s disease, making it an important option for otherwise refractory patients. Its use has been limited to these refractory patients because of concerns about the development of complications, especially progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. In this review, evidence-based data on the indications, efficacy and safety of natalizumab will be presented and its role in the management of patients with Crohn&amp;rsquo;s disease will be defined.Keywords: Crohn&amp;rsquo;s disease, natalizumab, alpha-4 integrin',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Background: Rotavirus C (RVC), a known etiological agent of diarrheal outbreaks, mainly inflicts swine population globally with sporadic incidence in human, cattle, ferret, mink and dog. Objective: To demonstrate the presence of RVC in Indian swine population and characterization of its selected structural (VP6) and non-structural (NSP4 and NSP5) genes. Methods: A total of 108 diarrheic samples from different regions of India were used. Isolated RNA was loaded onto polyacrylamide gel to screen for the presence of RVs through the identification of specific electrophoretic genomic migration pattern. To characterize the RVC strains, VP6 gene and NSP4 and NSP5 genes were amplified, sequenced and analyzed. Results: Based on VP6 gene specific diagnostic RT-PCR, the presence of RVC was confirmed in 12.0% (13/108) piglet fecal specimens. The nucleotide sequence analysis of VP6 gene, encoding inner capsid protein, from selected porcine RVC (PoRVC) strains revealed more than 93% homologies to human RVC strains (HuRVC) of Eurasian origin. These strains were distant from hitherto reported PoRVCs and clustered with HuRVCs, owning I2 genotype. However, the two non-structural genes, i.e. NSP4 and NSP5, of these strains were found to be of swine type, signifying a re-assortment event that has occurred in the Indian swine population. Conclusion: The findings indicate the presence of human-like RVC in Indian pigs and division of RVC clade with I2 genotype into further sub-clades. To the best of our knowledge, this appears to be the first report of RVC in Indian swine population. Incidence of human-like RVC VP6 gene in swine supports its subsequent zoonotic prospective.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Molecularly imprinted thin layers were prepared in silica capillaries by using two different surface polymerization strategies, the first using 4,4′-azobis(4-cyanovaleric acid) as a surface-coupled radical initiator, and the second, S-carboxypropyl-S’-benzyltrithiocarbonate as a reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) agent in combination with 2,2′-azobisisobutyronitrile as a free radical initiator. The ability to generate imprinted thin layers was tested on two different polymerization systems: (i) a 4-vinylpyridine/ethylene dimethacrylate (4VP-EDMA) in methanol-water solution with 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) as a template; and (ii) methacrylic acid/ethylene dimethacrylate (MAA-EDMA) in a chloroform solution with warfarin as the template molecule. The binding properties of the imprinted capillaries were studied and compared with those of the corresponding non-imprinted polymer coated capillaries by injecting the template molecule and by measuring its migration times relative to a neutral and non-retained marker. The role of running buffer hydrophobicity on recognition was investigated by studying the influence of varying buffer acetonitrile concentration. The 2,4,5-T-imprinted capillary showed molecular recognition based on a reversed phase mechanism, with a decrease of the template recognition in the presence of higher acetonitrile content; whereas warfarin-imprinted capillaries showed a bell-shaped trend upon varying the acetonitrile percentage, illustrating different mechanisms underlying imprinted polymer-ligand recognition. Importantly, the results demonstrated the validity of affinity capillary electrochromatography (CEC) to screen the binding properties of imprinted layers.',\n",

       "    'abstract': '<p>Abstract</p> <p>Background</p> <p>Aside from the stepwise genetic alterations known to underlie cancer cell creation, the microenvironment is known to profoundly influence subsequent tumor development, morphology and metastasis. Invasive cluster formation has been assumed to be dependent on directed migration and a heterogeneous environment - a conclusion derived from complex models of tumor-environment interaction. At the same time, these models have not included the prospect, now supported by a preponderance of evidence, that only a minority of cancer cells may have stem cell capacity. This proves to weigh heavily on the microenvironmental requirements for the display of characteristic tumor growth phenotypes. We show using agent-based modeling that some defining features of tumor growth ascribed to directed migration might also be realized under random migration, and discuss broader implications for cause-and-effect determination in general.</p> <p>Results</p> <p>Considering only the properties of random migration in tumors composed of stem cells and committed cells, we are able to recapitulate a characteristic clustering feature of invasive tumor growth, a property we attribute to \"self-metastatic\" growth. When the additional influence of directed migrations under chemotactic environments are considered, we find that tumor growth and invasive morphology are supported while the tumor is distant from the source, but are progressively discouraged as the tumor converges about that source.</p> <p>Conclusions</p> <p>We show that invasive clustering can derive from basic kinetic assumptions often neglected in more complex models. While higher-order mechanisms, e.g. directed migration upon chemotactic stimuli, may result in clustering growth morphologies, exclusive attributions of this phenotype to this or other structured microenvironments would be inappropriate, in light of our finding these features are observable in a homogeneous environment. Furthermore, directed migration will result in loss of the invasive phenotype as the tumor approaches the attractor source.

       "    'abstract': 'Regenerative retinal therapies have introduced progenitor cells to replace dysfunctional or injured neurons and regain visual function. While contemporary cell replacement therapies have delivered retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) within customized biomaterials to promote viability and enable transplantation, outcomes have been severely limited by the misdirected and/or insufficient migration of transplanted cells. RPCs must achieve appropriate spatial and functional positioning in host retina, collectively, to restore vision, whereas movement of clustered cells differs substantially from the single cell migration studied in classical chemotaxis models. Defining how RPCs interact with each other, neighboring cell types and surrounding extracellular matrixes are critical to our understanding of retinogenesis and the development of effective, cell-based approaches to retinal replacement. The current article describes a new bio-engineering approach to investigate the migratory responses of innate collections of RPCs upon extracellular substrates by combining microfluidics with the well-established invertebrate model of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Experiments utilized microfluidics to investigate how the composition, size, and adhesion of RPC clusters on defined extracellular substrates affected migration to exogenous chemotactic signaling. Results demonstrated that retinal cluster size and composition influenced RPC clustering upon extracellular substrates of concanavalin (Con-A), Laminin (LM), and poly-L-lysine (PLL), and that RPC cluster size greatly altered collective migratory responses to signaling from Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF), a primary chemotactic agent in <i>Drosophila</i>. These results highlight the significance of examining collective cell-biomaterial interactions on bio-substrates of emerging biomaterials to aid directional migration of transplanted cells. Our approach further introduces the benefits of pairing genetically controlled models with experimentally controlled microenvironments to advance cell replacement therapies.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Therapeutic agents that are transformable via introducing cleavable linkage by locally enriched MMP-2 within inflamed synovium would enhance therapeutic efficacy on chronic inflammatory arthritis. Transforming growth factor-β-inducible gene-h3 (βig-h3), which consists of four fas-1 domains and an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif, intensifies inflammatory processes by facilitating adhesion and migration of fibroblast-like synoviocyte in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The aim of this study was to investigate whether a MMP-2-cleavable peptide complex consisting of a fas-1 domain and an RGD peptide blocks the interaction between βig-h3 and resident cells and leads to the amelioration of inflammatory arthritis.We designed βig-h3-derivatives, including the fourth fas-1 domain truncated for H1 and H2 sequences of mouse (MFK00) and MMP-2-cleavable peptide complex (MFK902). MMP-2 selectivity was examined by treatment with a series of proteases. MFK902 efficacy was determined by the adhesion and migration assay with NIH3T3 cells in vitro and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model using male DBA/1J mice in vivo. The mice were treated intraperitoneally with MFK902 at different dosages.MFK902 was specifically cleaved by active MMP-2 in a concentration-dependent manner, and βig-h3-mediated adhesion and migration were more effectively inhibited by MFK902, compared with RGD or MFK00 peptides. The arthritis activity of murine CIA, measured by clinical arthritis index and incidence of arthritic paws, was significantly ameliorated after treatment with all dosages of MFK902 (1, 10, and 30 mg/kg). MFK902 ameliorated histopathologic deterioration and reduced the expression of inflammatory mediators simultaneously with improvement of clinical features. In addition, a favorable safety profile of MFK902 was demonstrated in vivo.The present study revealed that MMP-2-cleavable peptide complex based on βig-h3 structure is a potent and safe therapeutic agent for chronic inflammatory arthritis, thus providing reliable evidence for a MMP-2-cleavable mechanism as a tissue-targeted strategy for treatment of RA.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Constitutive activation of Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling is frequently detected in breast and pancreatic cancer. Inhibiting constitutive STAT3 signaling represents a promising molecular target for therapeutic approach. Using structure-based design, we developed a non-peptide cell-permeable, small molecule, termed as XZH-5, which targeted STAT3 phosphorylation. XZH-5 was found to inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation (Tyr705) and induce apoptosis in human breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines expressing elevated levels of phosphorylated STAT3. XZH-5 could also inhibit interleukin-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in cancer cell lines expressing low phosphorylated STAT3. Inhibition of STAT3 signaling by XZH-5 was confirmed by the down-regulation of downstream targets of STAT3, such as Cyclin D1, Bcl-2, and Survivin at mRNA level. In addition, XZH-5 inhibited colony formation, cell migration, and enhanced the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs when combined with Doxorubicin or Gemcitabine. Our results indicate that XZH-5 may be a potential therapeutic agent for breast and pancreatic cancers with constitutive STAT3 signaling.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Rationale: Enhanced proliferation and distal migration of human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (hPASMCs) both contribute to the progressive increases in pulmonary vascular remodeling and resistance in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Our previous studies revealed that Rictor deletion, to disrupt mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2), over longer periods result in a paradoxical rise in platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) expression in PASMCs. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of combination therapy targeting both mTOR signaling with PDGFR inhibition to attenuate the development and progression of PAH.Methods and Results: Immunoblotting analyses revealed that short-term exposure to rapamycin (6h) significantly reduced phosphorylation of p70S6K (mTORC1-specific) in hPASMCs but had no effect on the phosphorylation of AKT (p-AKT S473, considered mTORC2-specific). In contrast, longer rapamycin exposure (&gt;24\\xa0h), resulted in differential AKT (T308) and AKT (S473) phosphorylation with increases in phosphorylation of AKT at T308 and decreased phosphorylation at S473. Phosphorylation of both PDGFRα and PDGFRβ was increased in hPASMCs after treatment with rapamycin for 48 and 72\\xa0h. Based on co-immunoprecipitation studies, longer exposure to rapamycin (24–72\\xa0h) significantly inhibited the binding of mTOR to Rictor, mechanistically suggesting mTORC2 inhibition by rapamycin. Combined exposure of rapamycin with the PDGFR inhibitor, imatinib significantly reduced the proliferation and migration of hPASMCs compared to either agent alone. Pre-clinical studies validated increased therapeutic efficacy of rapamycin combined with imatinib in attenuating PAH over either drug alone. Specifically, combination therapy further attenuated the development of monocrotaline (MCT)- or Hypoxia/Sugen-induced pulmonary hypertension (PH) in rats as demonstrated by further reductions in the Fulton index, right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), pulmonary vascular wall thickness and vessel muscularization, and decreased proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) staining in PASMCs.Conclusion: Prolonged rapamycin treatment activates PDGFR signaling, in part, via mTORC2 inhibition. Combination therapy with rapamycin and imatinib may be a more effective strategy for the treatment of PAH.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The threat of invasive bigheaded carp swimming into the upper reaches of the Mississippi River (USA) demands new and effective approaches to block these species. To explore how navigational Lock and Dams (LDs) on the Mississippi River could be used to deter the upstream migration of invasive fish species, computer modelling that combined computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and agent-based (AB) fish passage model (CFD-AB model) could be used to hypothetically quantify the passage of bigheaded carp (<i>Hypophthalmichthys spp.</i>) through LDs. Agent-based fish (AB-fish) are always located on a node of the CFD mesh and move by selecting the neighboring node that minimizes fatigue. A possible limitation of this approach is that the AB-fish movement exhibits a dependence upon the CFD mesh. The proposed modified approach allows the AB-fish to occupy any point in the computational domain and to continually (within the size of the time step) update their minimum fatigue path. Computations in a simplified channel/dam structure show that the modified CFD-AB results are smoother swimming trajectories and increased estimates of fish passage when compared to the original CFD-AB model.',\n",

Several of these compounds exert their protective effect via inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. Identification of additional phytochemicals with potential antiangiogenic activity is important not only for understanding the mechanism of the preventive effect, but also for developing novel therapeutic interventions.</p> <p>Results</p> <p>In an attempt to identify phytochemicals contributing to the well-documented preventive effect of plant-based diets on cancer incidence and mortality, we have screened a set of hitherto untested phytoestrogen metabolites concerning their anti-angiogenic effect, using endothelial cell proliferation as an end point. Here, we show that a novel phytoestrogen, 6-methoxyequol (6-ME), inhibited VEGF-induced proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVE) cells, whereas VEGF-induced migration and survival of HUVE cells remained unaffected. In addition, 6-ME inhibited FGF-2-induced proliferation of bovine brain capillary endothelial (BBCE) cells. In line with its role in cell proliferation, 6-ME inhibited VEGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 MAPK, the key cascade responsible for VEGF-induced proliferation of endothelial cells. In this context, 6-ME inhibited in a dose dependent manner the phosphorylation of MEK1/2, the only known upstream activator of ERK1/2. 6-ME did not alter VEGF-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK or AKT, compatible with the lack of effect on VEGF-induced migration and survival of endothelial cells. Peri-tumor injection of 6-ME in A-431 xenograft tumors resulted in reduced tumor growth with suppressed neovasularization compared to vehicle controls (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01).</p> <p>Conclusions</p> <p>6-ME inhibits VEGF- and FGF2-induced proliferation of ECs by targeting the phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and it downstream substrate ERK1/2, both key components of the mitogenic MAPK pathway.

       "    'abstract': 'Abstract This paper presents a conceptual framework for dynamically migrating the decisions of multi-component robots within different physical subcomponents. At the higher layer, a decision-making distributed migration system embeds the rules written in a knowledge-based system (KBS). The rules are written and decisions are made at one component, which can be migrated by the underlying distributed system. This eventually results in intelligent migration of the decisions and robot survival, irrespective of a particular physical component failure. Moreover, a robot does not need an exclusive control system for each component. The implementation is a two-step process. Initially, component-specific facts are identified and mapped to suit to respective components and to write rules and explore different gestures and behaviour of the robot. The second step is the embedding of these rules within the distributed or agent-based system and allowing the decisions to float around the system. The Jess (Java Expert System Shell) expert system is used as the knowledge-based tool and different gestures are generated to realize the proposed method.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'With the rapid development of cloud computing, as an advantage of cloud services, virtual machine migration technology has been widely noticed and applied. However, there are some problems about VMs migration which should be solved, such as the complication of authentication of platform and the security issues of data transmission, etc. For these problems, firstly, the existing virtual machine migration scheme based on trusted computing technology was analyzed. Secondly, three secure needs that the virtual machine migration scheme which based on trusted computing technology should meet were proposed: the authenticated platform, confidentiality and integrity preserving transfer and atomicity of the vTPCM. Thirdly, a trusted migration scheme of virtual machines for cloud environment was proposed, in which the virtual machine central migration engine and trusted migration agent were introduced to solve the atomicity protection of vTPCM during the migration process. Finally, the concrete scheme was given with verification.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Coordination of cell proliferation and migration is fundamental for life, and its dysregulation has catastrophic consequences, such as cancer. How cell cycle progression affects migration, and vice versa, remains largely unknown. We address these questions by combining in silico modelling and in vivo experimentation in the zebrafish trunk neural crest (TNC). TNC migrate collectively, forming chains with a leader cell directing the movement of trailing followers. We show that the acquisition of migratory identity is autonomously controlled by Notch signalling in TNC. High Notch activity defines leaders, while low Notch determines followers. Moreover, cell cycle progression is required for TNC migration and is regulated by Notch. Cells with low Notch activity stay longer in G1 and become followers, while leaders with high Notch activity quickly undergo G1/S transition and remain in S-phase longer. In conclusion, TNC migratory identities are defined through the interaction of Notch signalling and cell cycle progression.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The search for effective strategies to inhibit tumorigenesis remains one of the most relevant scientific challenges. Among the most promising approaches is the direct modulation of the function of short non-coding RNAs, particularly miRNAs. These molecules are propitious targets for anticancer therapy, since they perform key regulatory roles in a variety of signaling cascades related to cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion. The development of pathological states is often associated with deregulation of miRNA expression. The present review describes in detail the strategies aimed at modulating miRNA activity that invoke antisense oligonucleotide construction, such as small RNA zippers, miRNases (miRNA-targeted artificial ribonucleases), miRNA sponges, miRNA masks, anti-miRNA oligonucleotides, and synthetic miRNA mimics. The broad impact of developed miRNA-based therapeutics on the various events of tumorigenesis is also discussed. Above all, the focus of this review is to evaluate the results of the combined application of different miRNA-based agents and chemotherapeutic drugs for the inhibition of tumor development. Many studies indicate a considerable increase in the efficacy of anticancer therapy as a result of additive or synergistic effects of simultaneously applied therapies. Different drug combinations, such as a cocktail of antisense oligonucleotides or multipotent miRNA sponges directed at several oncogenic microRNAs belonging to the same/different miRNA families, a mixture of anti-miRNA oligonucleotides and cytostatic drugs, and a combination of synthetic miRNA mimics, have a more complex and profound effect on the various events of tumorigenesis as compared with treatment with a single miRNA-based agent or chemotherapeutic drug. These data provide strong evidence that the simultaneous application of several distinct strategies aimed at suppressing different cellular processes linked to tumorigenesis is a promising approach for cancer therapy.',\n",

However, the survival, migration and therapeutic efficacy of EPCs after transplantation need to be better understood for further cell therapy. Purpose: This study investigated the migration effect of EPCs labeled with a multimodal imaging agent in a murine ischemic hindlimb model, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and optical imaging after transplantation. Methods: EPCs derived from mouse bone marrow were labeled with a multimodal imaging agent and were administered through intracardiac delivery to mice with ischemic hindlimbs. The injected EPCs and their migration effect were observed via MRI and optical imaging in vivo, and then compared to a reference standard based on histological data. The quantification of gadolinium in tissue samples was done using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Results: Using in vivo MRI and optical imaging, the labeled EPCs were observed to migrate to ischemic muscle on days 3&ndash;5 after injection, while ex vivo, the EPCs were observed in the capillary vessels of the injured tissue. There were significant linear correlations between the Gd contents measured using ICP-MS in samples from the ischemic hindlimbs and livers and T1 relaxation times calculated using MRI, as well as the average fluorescence signal intensities recorded in optical images (T1 relaxation time: r=0.491; average signal from optical imaging: r=0.704, P&lt;0.01). EPC treatment upregulated the levels of C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2 and enhanced the expression of stromal cell-derived factor-1 and VEGF. Conclusion: Transplanted EPCs can be monitored with noninvasive MRI and optical imaging in vivo and were found to enhance the paracrine secretion of angiogenic factors.

       "    'abstract': 'Abstract Background Melanoma is a malignant tumor with high misdiagnosis rate and poor prognosis. The bio-targeted therapy is a prevailing method in the treatment of melanoma; however, the accompanying drug resistance is inevitable. SH2 superbinder, a triple-mutant of the Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain, shows potent antitumor ability by replacing natural SH2-containing proteins and blocking multiple pY-based signaling pathways. Polyarginine (Arg)9, a powerful vector for intracellular delivery of large molecules, could transport therapeutic agents across cell membrane. The purpose of this study is to construct (Arg)9-SH2 superbinder and investigate its effects on melanoma cells, expecting to provide potential new approaches for anti-cancer therapy and overcoming the unavoidable drug resistance of single-targeted antitumor agents. Methods (Arg)9 and SH2 superbinder were fused to form (Arg)9-SH2 superbinder via genetic engineering. Pull down assay was performed to identify that (Arg)9-SH2 superbinder could capture a wide variety of pY proteins. Immunofluorescence was used to detect the efficiency of (Arg)9-SH2 superbinder entering cells. The proliferation ability was assessed by MTT and colony formation assay. In addition, wound healing and transwell assay were performed to evaluate migration of B16F10, A375 and A375/DDP cells. Moreover, apoptosis caused by (Arg)9-SH2 superbinder was analyzed by flow cytometry-based Annexin V/PI. Furthermore, western blot revealed that (Arg)9-SH2 superbinder influenced some pY-related signaling pathways. Finally, B16F10 xenograft model was established to confirm whether (Arg)9-SH2 superbinder could restrain the growth of tumor. Results Our data showed that (Arg)9-SH2 superbinder had the ability to enter melanoma cells effectively and displayed strong affinities for various pY proteins. Furthermore, (Arg)9-SH2 superbinder could repress proliferation, migration and induce apoptosis of melanoma cells by regulating PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK and JAK/STAT signaling pathways. Importantly, (Arg)9-SH2 superbinder could significantly inhibit the growth of tumor in mice. Conclusions (Arg)9-SH2 superbinder exhibited high affinities for pY proteins, which showed effective anticancer ability by replacing SH2-containing proteins and blocking diverse pY-based pathways. The remarkable ability of (Arg)9-SH2 superbinder to inhibit cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth might open the door to explore the SH2 superbinder as a therapeutic agent for cancer treatment.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Cancer cell resistance to anoikis driven by aberrant signaling sustained by the tumor microenvironment confers high invasive potential and therapeutic resistance. We recently generated a novel lead quinazoline-based Doxazosin® derivative, DZ-50, which impairs tumor growth and metastasis via anoikis. Genome-wide analysis in the human prostate cancer cell line DU-145 identified primary downregulated targets of DZ-50, including genes involved in focal adhesion integrity (fibronectin, integrin-α6 and talin), tight junction formation (claudin-11) as well as insulin growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) and the angiogenesis modulator thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1). Confocal microscopy demonstrated structural disruption of both focal adhesions and tight junctions by the downregulation of these gene targets, resulting in decreased cell survival, migration and adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) components in two androgen-independent human prostate cancer cell lines, PC-3 and DU-145. Stabilization of cell-ECM interactions by overexpression of talin-1 and/or exposing cells to a fibronectin-rich environment mitigated the effect of DZ-50. Loss of expression of the intracellular focal adhesion signaling effectors talin-1 and integrin linked kinase (ILK) sensitized human prostate cancer to anoikis. Our findings suggest that DZ-50 exerts its antitumor effect by targeting the key functional intercellular interactions, focal adhesions and tight junctions, supporting the therapeutic significance of this agent for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Introduction: Platelets are smallest blood cells of discoid or round shape and are cytoplasmic fragments of megakaryocytes. Platelets consist of 3 types of granules: alpha granules, dense granules and lysosomes. Granule secretion releases coagulation factors, growth factors, cytokines, and a number of proteolytic enzymes. Platelets contain a number of receptors known as platelet agonists. Basic and most studied role of platelets is in hemostasis process. The aim of this paper is to point on platelet function unrelated to hemostasis. Matherials and methods: Papers on other recognized functions of platelets were searched for in biomedical journals idexed in MEDLINE form 2004 to 2016. Topic: This paper studies less known platelet functions becoming subject of interest with the development of applied science. Platelets participate in inflammation by releasing proinflammatory mediators (CD154, CD40L). Complement activation via Pselectin, platelet-generates immunomodulatory effect. CD40L accelerates releasing RANTES protein leading to intensified activation of T-lymphocytes. During embryonic development, platelets allow blood and lymph vessels separation by activating CLE-2 receptor and ligand PDPN. Platelets alleviate migration and invasiveness of tumor cells, contribute to disease progression and development of metastases. Platelets affect maturation of follicles and oocytes and have important role in embryo implantation process and placentation. Conclusion: Based on these findings, conclusion imposes platelets as not only active participants in the hemostasis process but as having significant role in inflammation, unspecified and specified body defending, tumor biology, embryonic development and in female reproductive system regulation. Numerous roles of platelets open wide range for the new drugs' operation. Their specific characteristic is the basis for the personalized Clinical pharmacology development and possibility of applying specific drug as polyindicative therapeutic agent.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Abstract Background Fibrosis is the formation of excess connective tissue in an organ or tissue during a reparative or reactive process. Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is a medical complication of allogeneic tissue transplantation with transplanted donor T cell-mediated inflammatory response; it is characterized by a severe immune response with fibrosis in the final stage of the inflammatory process. T helper 17 cells play a critical role in the pathogenesis of GvHD. Fingolimod (FTY720), an analogue of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), is an effective immunosuppressive agent in experimental transplantation models. Methods In this study, we evaluated the effects of FTY720 as a treatment for an animal GvHD model with inflammation and fibrosis. The splenocytes, lymph nodes, blood, tissues from Syngeneic mice and GvHD-induced mice treated vehicle or FTY720 were compared using flow cytometry, hematological analyses, histologic analyses. Results FTY720 reduced clinical scores based on the following five clinical parameters: weight loss, posture, activity, fur texture, and skin integrity. FACS data showed that T lymphocyte numbers increased in mesenteric lymph nodes and decreased in splenocytes of FTY720-treated mice. Tissue analysis showed that FTY720 reduced skin, intestinal inflammation, and fibrotic markers. FTY720 dramatically decreased α-smooth muscle actin, connective tissue growth factor, and fibronectin protein levels in keloid skin fibroblasts. Conclusions Thus, FTY720 suppressed migration of pathogenic T cells to target organs, reducing inflammation. FTY720 also inhibited fibrogenesis marker expression in vitro and in vivo. Together, these results suggest that FTY720 prevents GvHD progression via immunosuppression of TH17 and simultaneously acts an anti-fibrotic agent.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Introduction of virtualization containers and container orchestrators fundamentally changed the landscape of cloud application development. Containers provide an ideal way for practical implementation of microservice-based architecture, which allows for repeatable, generic patterns that make the development of reliable, distributed applications more approachable and efficient. Orchestrators allow for shifting the accidental complexity from inside of an application into the automated cloud infrastructure. Existing container orchestrators are centralized systems that schedule containers to the cloud servers only at their startup. In this paper, we propose a swarm-like distributed cloud management system that uses live migration of containers to dynamically reassign application components to the different servers. It is based on the idea of “pheromone” robots. An additional mobile agent process is placed inside each application container to control the migration process. The number of parallel container migrations needed to reach an optimal state of the cloud is obtained using models, experiments, and simulations. We show that in the most common scenarios the proposed swarm-like algorithm performs better than existing systems, and due to its architecture it is also more scalable and resilient to container death. It also adapts to the influx of containers and addition of new servers to the cloud automatically.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Background: There is no standard posttreatment for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in whom lenvatinib therapy has failed. This study aimed to investigate rates of migration to posttreatment after lenvatinib and to explore candidates for second-line agents in the patients with failed lenvatinib therapy. Methods: We retrospectively collected data on patients with advanced HCC who received lenvatinib as the first-line agent in 7 institutions. Results: Overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS) of 178 patients who received lenvatinib as the first-line agent were 13.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.5–15.2) and 6.7 months (95% CI, 5.6–7.8), respectively. Sixty-nine of 151 patients (45.7%) who discontinued lenvatinib moved on to posttreatment. The migration rates from lenvatinib to the second-line agent and from the second-line agent to the third-line agent were 41.7 and 44.4%, respectively. Based on multivariate analysis, response to lenvatinib (complete or partial response according to modified RECIST) and discontinuation of lenvatinib due to radiological progression, as well as male were associated with a significantly higher probability of migration to posttreatment after lenvatinib. On the other hand, alpha-fetoprotein levels of 400 ng/mL or higher was correlated with a significantly lower probability of migration to posttreatment after lenvatinib. Of 63 patients who received second-line systemic therapy, 53 (84.2%) were administered sorafenib. PFS, objective response rate (ORR), and disease control rate (DCR) for sorafenib treatment were 1.8 months (95% CI, 0.6–3.0), 1.8%, and 20.8%, respectively. According to the Cox regression hazard model, Child-Pugh class B significantly contributed to shorter PFS. PFS, ORR, and DCR of 22 patients who received regorafenib after lenvatinib in any lines were 3.2 months (range, 1.5–4.9 months), 13.6%, and 36.3%, respectively. Similarly, PFS, ORR, and DCR of 17 patients who received regorafenib after lenvatinib in the third-line (after sorafenib) were 3.8 months (range, 1.1–6.5 months), 17.6%, and 41.2%, respectively. Conclusion: Sorafenib may not be a candidate for use as a posttreatment agent after lenvatinib, according to the results of the present study. Regorafenib has the potential to become an appropriate posttreatment agent after lenvatinib.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The endophytic and nematophagous fungus <i>Pochonia chlamydosporia</i> is an efficient biological control agent of plant-parasitic nematodes. Isolates of the fungus can be allocated to a biotype group according to the nematode host, but it is unknown if genetic interchange can occur between different biotypes, which may affect their parasitic performance. An anastomosis assay was conducted in vitro to assess hyphae vegetative compatibility/incompatibility followed by a PCR-based mating-type assay genotyping of five isolates of <i>P. chlamydosporia</i> var. <i>chlamydoporia</i> of the <i>Meloidogyne</i> sp. (Pc10, Pc190, Pc309), <i>Globodera</i> sp. (Pc280) and <i>Heterodera avenae</i> (Pc60) biotypes, including 16 pairwise isolates combinations in four replicates. Pairwise combinations were tested on glass slides and mycelia were stained to confirm nuclei migration between anastomosing hyphae using fluorescence microscopy. Anastomosis only occurred between mycelium hyphae of the same isolate and biotype. Mating-type PCR-based molecular assays showed that all isolates were heterothallic. The <i>MAT1-1</i> genotype was found in isolates Pc10, Pc190, Pc280, Pc309, and the <i>MAT1-2</i> genotype in Pc60. The results showed a vegetative incompatibility among isolates, suggesting the occurrence of such interactions for their respective biotypes. Anastomosis and PCR mating-type results suggest that different fungal biotypes can occur in the same niche but that genetic incompatibility mechanisms, such as mating-type, may limit or impede viable heterokaryosis.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Ovarian cancer (OvCa) is the fifth most common cause of death from all cancers among women in United Sates and the leading cause of death from gynecological malignancies. While most OvCa patients initially respond to surgical debulking and chemotherapy, 75% of patients later succumb to the disease. Thus, there is an urgent need to test novel therapeutic agents to counteract the high mortality rate associated with OvCa. In this context, we have developed and engineered Nanoceria (NCe), nanoparticles of cerium oxide, possessing anti-oxidant properties, to be used as a therapeutic agent in OvCa. We show for the first time that NCe significantly inhibited production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in A2780 cells, attenuated growth factor (SDF1, HB-EGF, VEGF(165) and HGF) mediated cell migration and invasion of SKOV3 cells, without affecting the cell proliferation. NCe treatment also inhibited VEGF(165) induced proliferation, capillary tube formation, activation of VEGFR2 and MMP2 in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC). NCe (0.1 mg/kg body weigh) treatment of A2780 ovarian cancer cells injected intra-peritoneally in nude mice showed significant reduction (p<0.002) in tumor growth accompanied by decreased tumor cell proliferation as evident from reduced tumor size and Ki67 staining. Accumulation of NCe was found in tumors isolated from treated group using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). Reduction of the tumor mass was accompanied by attenuation of angiogenesis, as observed by reduced CD31 staining and specific apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells. Collectively, these results indicate that cerium oxide based NCe is a novel nanoparticle that can potentially be used as an anti-angiogenic therapeutic agent in ovarian cancer.',\n",
