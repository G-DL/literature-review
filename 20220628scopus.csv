The effect of copepod community structure, feeding behavior, and diel vertical migration (DVM) on fecal pellet carbon flux was investigated using an agent-based model, which was applied to two contrasting open ocean regions: an oligotrophic (Hawaii Ocean Time-series site ALOHA) and a mesotrophic (Japanese time-series site K2) system. Data from the VERtical Transport in the Global Ocean (VERTIGO) project was used to parameterize the model, and modelled fecal pellet fluxes were compared to field-derived neutrally buoyant sediment trap data to examine how community structure and DVM impact fecal pellet carbon flux in the water column. The model produces copepod fecal pellet fluxes that are consistent with sediment trap data from K2 and ALOHA and with other modeling studies. The vertical distribution of copepods matching nighttime field data resulted in a greater magnitude of fecal pellet flux at all model depths compared to daytime distributions. Communities dominated by omnivores resulted in higher fecal pellet carbon flux and lower POC attenuation than those dominated by carnivores or detritivores. Incorporating DVM into the simulations produced lower fecal pellet fluxes in some cases, while also marginally improving the agreement between the modeled and observed median fecal pellet fluxes. The relatively simplified model presented here shows that an agent-based model that uses trait-based relationships for physiological rates can be used to give insight into the variability of particle flux in the deep ocean. © 2022"

A model of the evolutionary dynamics of a community consisting of local (indigenous) and external (migrants) populations interacting in an artificial socioeconomic system is proposed, in which the key sectors of the economy are identified: the extraction of raw materials (primary sector, attracting mainly migrants), the manufacturing sector (secondary sector attracting predominantly indigenous people), and low-tech and high-tech services (tertiary and quaternary sectors of the economy attracting migrants and indigenous people, respectively). The formation of jobs in these sectors of the economy is carried out centrally using the previously proposed fuzzy clustering algorithm. Simulation experiments are carried out, and the effects of segregation due to the desire of agents to search for the most desirable jobs in a bounded neighborhood under various scenario conditions are studied. Using the proposed genetic algorithm, an important optimization problem is solved to maximize GDP growth rates and minimize the level of the population’s segregation. © 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

Worldwide, land-based environmental conservation efforts and agricultural preservation regulations are often concurrent. Complex social-ecological feedback within the coupled natural and human systems nevertheless confounds their effects. Drawing on population-level data for a township encompassed by a national nature reserve, this study applies a spatially explicit agent-based model to understand human-environment interrelationships with household land-use decisions about cropland abandonment restricted by the agricultural preservation rule. Results show that labor migration and cropland abandonment involve feedback loops that exhibit nonlinear effects. The availability of household labor and the amount of cultivated land mediate these effects. The land-use decisions of the farm households are sensitive to the relaxation of the abandonment restriction. The prevalence of cropland abandonment in extent and size increases prominently as the restriction rule begins to relax. The model shows a clearly emerging spatial pattern of an increasing likelihood of cropland abandonment with the relaxed restriction. Abandonment is more likely on dryland parcels and parcels at higher elevations, steeper slopes, and in proximity to forest areas. The shifted distributions of cropland parcels by their biophysical and geographical features from the baseline scenario (full restriction) to the experimental scenario (complete relaxation) also demonstrate these trends. Targeting cropland parcels bearing high risks of abandonment can improve the cost-effectiveness of implementing forest restoration policies while prioritizing those with low risks for agricultural stabilization. The agent-based model is useful for explaining the underlying drivers of land change involving human decision-making. It also suggests implications for balancing trade-offs between environmental conservation and agricultural production. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

The actin cytoskeleton undergoes significant reorganization in many different contexts, including during directed cell migration and over the course of the cell cycle, when cortical actin can transition between different configurations such as open patched meshworks, homogeneous distributions, and aligned bundles. Several types of myosin motor proteins, characterized by different kinetic parameters, have been involved in this reorganization of actin filaments. Given the limitations in studying the interactions of actin with myosin in vivo, we propose stochastic agent-based models and develop a set of data analysis measures to assess how myosin motor proteins mediate various actin organizations. In particular, we identify individual motor parameters, such as motor binding rate and step size, that generate actin networks with different levels of contractility and different patterns of myosin motor localization, which have previously been observed experimentally. In simulations where two motor populations with distinct kinetic parameters interact with the same actin network, we find that motors may act in a complementary way, by tuning the actin network organization, or in an antagonistic way, where one motor emerges as dominant. This modeling and data analysis framework also uncovers parameter regimes where spatial segregation between motor populations is achieved. By allowing for changes in kinetic rates during the actin-myosin dynamic simulations, our work suggests that certain actin-myosin organizations may require additional regulation beyond mediation by motor proteins in order to reconfigure the cytoskeleton network on experimentally-observed timescales.

Our aim is to study the tumour heterogeneity due to the geometry of a growing tumour caused by the phenotypic transformations of cells. In this context, an early vascular growth is considered after angiogenesis. Hence, the microenvironment of the solid tumour is rich of oxygen and nutrients. It is also considered that epidermal growth factor (EGF) is distributed into the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) of the tumour. The developed multi-layered model consists of three layers: intracellular or subcellular, cellular, and extracellular or tissue layer. The model integrates the events that occur simultaneously in these three layers to identify the underlying diversity. Here, every cell is represented as an agent. Characteristics of an agent are controlled by its intracellular protein expressions and its surrounding microenvironment. A mature proliferative or migratory or hybrid cell agent spawn two indistinguishable children unless it may convert into other phenotype due to influence of the microenvironment. Further, a simple cell cycle model is adapted which is influenced by EGF-EGFR signalling pathway and the external oxygen and nutrients. Moreover, migratory and hybrid cells secrete several matrix degrading enzymes (MDEs) which remodel the ECM for tumour invasion locally. Several biomechanical forces are considered that simultaneously act on the cancer cells. The outcome of the model is very similar to the results reported in earlier studies. The model shows the characteristics of cancer invasion that include sustainable proliferation by ignoring growth suppressor signals and reproduction of cancer cells at abnormal proportion, restrict apoptosis, and invade into the surrounding tissue. As the simulation parameters get modified due to different biochemical and biophysical processes, the robustness of the model is determined. It is found that only a number of proliferative cells are moderately sensitive to the parameters and others are less-sensitive.

The risk to golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) is of particular concern due to their small population size and conservation status. Golden eagles subsidize their flight in part by soaring in orographic updrafts, which can place them in conflict with wind turbines utilizing the same low-altitude wind resource. Understanding the behavior of soaring raptors in varying atmospheric conditions can therefore be relevant to predicting and mitigating their risk of collision. We present a predictive movement model that simulates individual paths of golden eagles during directional flight (such as migration) that is subsidized by orographic updraft. We modeled eagles in a 50 km by 50 km study area in Wyoming containing three wind power plants with documented golden eagle collisions with turbines. The movement model is applicable to any region where ground elevation is known at turbine scale (<50 m) and wind conditions are known at facility scale (<3 km). For a given set of atmospheric conditions, the model simulates movements of thousands of orographic soaring eagles to produce a density map quantifying the relative probability of eagle presence. We validated the simulated tracks with GPS telemetry data showing four directional tracks made by golden eagles transiting through the area in 2019 and 2020. For each eagle track, validation was performed using the ratio of the model-simulated eagle presence likelihood with uniform eagle presence and the presence computed using directed random-walk movements. We found that the predictive performance of the model was significantly better (likelihood ratio >1) for low-altitude movements than high-altitude movements that can involve thermal-soaring. We employed the model to produce seasonal presence maps for migrating golden eagles. We found significant turbine-level variations in eagle presence between northerly and southerly migration routes through the study area. Overall, the proposed model offers a generalizable, probabilistic, and predictive tool to assist wind energy developers, ecologists, wildlife managers, and industry consultants in estimating the potential for conflict between soaring birds and wind turbines, thereby reducing the need for site-specific data on golden eagle movements. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."

In this study, an agent-based model is developed to understand the dynamics of such emigration. We hypothesize that skilled people's emigration decisions are based on several factors including the overall economic and social difference between the home and host countries, people's ability and capacity to obtain good jobs and start a life abroad, and the barriers of moving abroad. Furthermore, the social network of individuals also plays a significant role. The model is validated using qualitative and quantitative pattern matching with real-world observations. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses are performed in addition to several scenario analyses. Linear and random forest response surface models are created to provide quick predictions on the number of emigrants and to understand the effect sizes of individual parameters. Overall, this study provides an abstract model where brain drain dynamics can be explored. Findings from the simulation outputs show that the future socioeconomic state of the country is more important than the current state, lack of barriers results in a large number of emigrants, and network effects ensure compounding effects on emigration. Upon further development and customization, future versions can assist in the decision-making of social policymakers regarding brain drain. © 2014 IEEE."

We show that a female-limited polymorphism in dorsal patterning (diamond/chevron) in the brown anole is controlled by a single Mendelian locus. This locus contains the gene CCDC170 that is adjacent to, and coexpressed with, the Estrogen receptor-1 gene, explaining why the polymorphism is female limited. CCDC170 is an organizer of the Golgi-microtubule network underlying a cell's ability to migrate, and the two segregating alleles encode structurally different proteins. Our agent-based modeling of skin development demonstrates that, in principle, a change in cell migratory behaviors is sufficient to switch between the two morphs. These results suggest that CCDC170 might have been co-opted as a switch between color patterning morphs, likely by modulating cell migratory behaviors. Copyright © 2022 The Authors"

Hydrocarbons are released from deeply buried and heated source rocks, such as shales with a high organic content. They then migrate upwards through the overlying lithologies. Some hydrocarbon becomes trapped in suitable geological structures that, over a geological timescale, produce viable hydrocarbon reservoirs. This work investigates how intelligent agent models can mimic these complex natural subsurface processes and account for geological uncertainty. Phys-ics‐based approaches are commonly used in petroleum system modelling and flow simulation software to identify migration pathways from source rocks to traps. However, the problem with these simulations is that they are computationally demanding, making them infeasible for exten-sive uncertainty quantification. In this work, we present a novel dynamic screening tool for secondary hydrocarbon migration that relies on agent‐based modelling. It is fast and is therefore suitable for uncertainty quantification, before using petroleum system modelling software for a more accurate evaluation of migration scenarios. We first illustrate how interacting but independent agents can mimic the movement of hydrocarbon molecules using a few simple rules by focusing on the main drivers of migration: buoyancy and capillary forces. Then, using a synthetic case study, we validate the usefulness of the agent modelling approach to quantify the impact of geological parameter uncertainty (e.g., fault transmissibility, source rock location, expulsion rate) on potential hydrocarbon accumulations and migrations pathways, an essential task to enable quick de‐risking of a likely prospect. © 2022 by the authors.

Additive manufacturing (AM) presents an opportunity to manufacture affordable patient-specific implants. Optimization of the implant–bone interface to maximize osseointegration (bone ingrowth) has not been appropriately addressed. Mechanobiological models, suited to predict mechanical adaptation of bone, cannot be used to predict osseointegration inside implants as the implant is not exposed to any mechanical loading until it is fully accepted by the host body. Biological models relying on partial differential equations based on continuum approximation are not well-suited to predict the discrete phenomenon of osseointegration. This study proposes an agent-based modeling (ABM) approach for representing the osseointegration process for orthopedic implants produced by powder-bed additive manufacturing processes. Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) is a cellular automata based discrete computing technique that uses rule-based mathematics derived from experimental studies to simulate evolutionary phenomena. In this paper, osseointegration inside a hexagonal closed packing of AM powder particles is modeled using ABM. Cellular agents such as pre-osteoblasts and osteoblasts are realistically modeled as cubic cells.

This approach is based on the previously developed simulation model of interaction between two communities: migrants and natives that is implemented in the AnyLogic simulation software. The model has had a low dimensionality of the discrete space representing the operating environment of the agent populations and a deterministic decision-making system of each agent. At the same time, the presence of multiple interactions between agents and transitions between their states determines a high computational complexity of such a model. The use of FLAME GPU makes it possible to conduct extensive simulation experiments with the model, mainly due to the parallelization of computational processes at the level of each agent, as well as the implementation of the mechanism of multiple computations using Monte Carlo techniques. The developed framework is used to study the impact of the most important parameters of the model (e.g., rate of migration, governmental expenditures on integration, frequency of creation of new workplaces, etc.) on the key outputs of the modeled socio-economic system (in particular, population size, share of migrants, number of assimilated migrants, GDP growth rate, etc.). The proposed approach can be used to develop decision-making systems for planning the hiring of new employees based on the forecast dynamics of migration and demographic processes. © Franz Steiner Verlag, Stuttgart 2022"

Although there have been many studies evaluating the effects of telecouplings, telecouplings in those studies were often investigated separately, and how telecouplings may interact and affect dynamics of rural coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) jointly was rarely evaluated. In this study, we developed an agent-based model and simulated the impacts of two globally common telecouplings, nature-based tourism and labor migration, on forest dynamics of a rural CHANS, China’s Wolong Nature Reserve (Wolong). Nature-based tourism and labor migration can facilitate forest recovery, and the predicted forest areas in Wolong in 2030 would be reduced by 26.2 km2 (6.8%) and 23.9 km2 (6.2%), respectively, without their effects. However, tourism development can significantly reduce the probability of local households to have member(s) outmigrate to work in cities and decrease the positive impact of labor migration on forest recovery. Our simulations show that the interaction between tourism and labor migration can reduce the potential forest recovery by 3.5 km2 (5.0%) in 2030. Our study highlights that interactions among different telecouplings can generate significant impacts on socioeconomic and environmental outcomes and should be jointly considered in the design, management, and evaluation of telecouplings for achieving sustainable development goals. © 2022, American Meteorological Society.

This is because NSCs can circumvent the blood-brain barrier and migrate to areas of damage in the central nervous system, including tumors, stroke, and wound injuries. However, for successful clinical application of NSC treatment, a sufficient number of viable cells must reach the diseased or damaged area(s) in the brain, and evidence suggests that it may be affected by the paths the NSCs take through the brain, as well as the locations of tumors. To study the NSC migration in brain, we develop a mathematical model of therapeutic NSC migration towards brain tumor, that provides a low cost platform to investigate NSC treatment efficacy. Our model is an extension of the model developed in Rockne et al. (PLoS ONE 13, e0199967, 2018) that considers NSC migration in non-tumor bearing naive mouse brain. Here we modify the model in Rockne et al. in three ways: (i) we consider three-dimensional mouse brain geometry, (ii) we add chemotaxis to model the tumor-tropic nature of NSCs into tumor sites, and (iii) we model stochasticity of migration speed and chemosensitivity. The proposed model is used to study migration patterns of NSCs to sites of tumors for different injection strategies, in particular, intranasal and intracerebral delivery. We observe that intracerebral injection results in more NSCs arriving at the tumor site(s), but the relative fraction of NSCs depends on the location of injection relative to the target site(s). On the other hand, intranasal injection results in fewer NSCs at the tumor site, but yields a more even distribution of NSCs within and around the target tumor site(s). © 2022 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press."

A current phenomena is short-term rentals of private homes. In its peer-to-peer form, this phenomena has grown sharply, facilitated by services such as Airbnb. Its growth has caused controversies among communities in touristic areas of Amsterdam, since it contributes to a changed social fabric, increased housing prices and overall gentrification. In the Netherlands and elsewhere, municipal and national policy makers are interested to regulate short-term rentals. In order to provide insights into qualitative policy effects, we develop a micro-level agent-based simulation. Our spatial model simulates residential migration based on income and house pricing. The underlying economic theory is that of Smith’s rent-gap hypothesis. Our model is among the first agent-based approaches investigating this type of rental market, and the first to model a specific housing market, including social housing, in a geographically accurate way. Simulation analysis shows that the touristic rental market has caused considerable changes in housing prices and population development. We find that more lower income citizens remain in the city centre when regulation of the market is stronger, and that banning the touristic market restrains the overall increase in house prices, compared to the business-as-usual scenario. However, the feasibility of enforcement of regulation, and its libertarian consequences, must be considered. © The Author(s) 2021."

Mathematical biology seeks to explain biophysical processes in mathematical terms at, and across, all relevant spatial and temporal scales, through the generation of representative models. While non-spatial, ordinary differential equation (ODE) models are often used and readily calibrated to experimental data, they do not explicitly represent the spatial and stochastic features of a biological system, limiting their insights and applications. However, spatial models describing biological systems with spatial information are mathematically complex and computationally expensive, which limits the ability to calibrate and deploy them and highlights the need for simpler methods able to model the spatial features of biological systems. Results: In this work, we develop a formal method for deriving cell-based, spatial, multicellular models from ODE models of population dynamics in biological systems, and vice versa. We provide examples of generating spatiotemporal, multicellular models from ODE models of viral infection and immune response. In these models, the determinants of agreement of spatial and non-spatial models are the degree of spatial heterogeneity in viral production and rates of extracellular viral diffusion and decay. We show how ODE model parameters can implicitly represent spatial parameters, and cell-based spatial models can generate uncertain predictions through sensitivity to stochastic cellular events, which is not a feature of ODE models. Using our method, we can test ODE models in a multicellular, spatial context and translate information to and from non-spatial and spatial models, which help to employ spatiotemporal multicellular models using calibrated ODE model parameters. We additionally investigate objects and processes implicitly represented by ODE model terms and parameters and improve the reproducibility of spatial, stochastic models. Conclusion: We developed and demonstrate a method for generating spatiotemporal, multicellular models from non-spatial population dynamics models of multicellular systems. We envision employing our method to generate new ODE model terms from spatiotemporal and multicellular models, recast popular ODE models on a cellular basis, and generate better models for critical applications where spatial and stochastic features affect outcomes. © 2021, The Author(s)."

In large protected North American areas such as Yellowstone and Wood Buffalo National Parks, aquatic habitats are disappearing and wetland-dependent fauna are in decline1–3. Here we investigate population dynamics of an indicator species in Canada’s Peace-Athabasca Delta (“the delta”), a World Heritage Site. Based on population surveys, habitat mapping and genetic data from 288 muskrats, we use agent-based modeling and genetic analyses to explain population expansion and decline of the semi-aquatic muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus). Simulations quantify a large population (~500,000 individuals) following flood-induced habitat gains, with decreased size (~10,000 individuals) during drying. Genetic analyses show extremely low long-term effective population size (Ne: 60–127), supporting a legacy of population bottlenecks. Our simulations indicate that the muskrat population in the delta is a metapopulation with individuals migrating preferentially along riparian pathways. Related individuals found over 40 km apart imply dispersal distances far greater than their typical home range (130 m). Rapid metapopulation recovery is achieved via riparian corridor migration and passive flood-transport of individuals. Source-sink dynamics show wetland loss impacts on the muskrat metapopulation’s spatial extent. Dramatic landscape change is underway, devastating local fauna, including this generalist species even in a protected ecosystem. © 2021, The Author(s)."

We aim to explore mechanisms and develop scenarios, which are going to be validated through further research. We use a model of a simple pastoralist society in a world without borders to migration by adding the possibility of experiencing the effects of social structures (such as family and friends) and technological networks (e.g., social media). It appears obvious that pastoralist mobility depends on other dimensions as land tenure and traditional knowledge; however, isolating these two effects and experimenting in a simple society allow us to filter the multidimensionality of mobility decisions and concentrate on comparing scenarios in several different social structures and technological network combinations. The results show an expected behavior of more connection and more mobility, and a non-linear emergent behavior where pastoralists wait for a longer amount of time to mobilize when they interact using powerful social and technological networks. This occurs until they decide to move, and then, they mobilize more quickly and strongly than they did when communication was non-existent between them. The literature on migration explains this emergent non-linear behavior. © 2021, The Author(s)."

Behavioral particle-tracking models (PTM) of Chinook salmon can estimate migration paths of salmon using the combination of hydrodynamic velocity and swimming behavior. To test our hypotheses of the importance of management, models can simulate historical conditions and alternative management scenarios such as flow manipulation and modification of channel geometry. Swimming behaviors in these models are often specified to match aggregated observed properties such as transit time estimated from acoustic telemetry data. In our study, we estimate swimming behaviors at 5 s intervals directly from acoustic telemetry data and concurrent high-resolution three-dimensional hydrodynamic model results at the junction of the San Joaquin River and Old River in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California. We use the swimming speed dataset to specify a stochastic swimming behavior consistent with observations of instantaneous swimming. We then evaluate the effect of individual components of the swimming formulation on predicted route selection and the consistency with observed route selection. The PTM predicted route selection fractions are similar among passive and active swimming behaviors for most tags, but the observed route selection for some tags would be unlikely under passive behavior leading to the conclusion that active swimming behavior influenced the route selection of several tagged smolts. © 2021 by the authors.

The question of how a capacity for adaptive migrations influences the success of a microbial population in various conditions is a challenge addressed in this study. We employed the agent-based model of competition of motile and sedentary microbial populations in a confined aquatic environment supplied with a periodic batch nutrient source to assess the fitness of both. Such factors as nutrient concentration in a batch, batch period, mortality type and energetic costs of migration were considered to determine the conditions favouring different strategies: Nomad of a motile population and Settler of a sedentary one. The modelling results demonstrate that dynamic and nutrient-scarce environments favour motile populations, whereas nutrient-rich and stagnant environments promote sedentary microorganisms. Energetic costs of migration determine whether or not the Nomad strategy of the motile population is successful, though it also depends on such conditions as nutrient availability. Even without penalties for migration, under certain conditions, the sedentary Settler population dominates in the ecosystem. It is achieved by decreasing the local nutrient availability near the nutrient source, as motile populations relying on a local optimizing strategy tend to follow benign conditions and fail, enduring stress associated with crossing the valleys of suboptimal nutrient availability. © 2021 by the authors.

Mobile agents move between various network-enabled platforms to process the information they manage. To simulate an environment based on the Internet of Things (IoT), a scheme has been presented which details the necessary steps to be carried out by the agent to perform the migration.

However, the importance of security mechanisms to reduce and/or mitigate security threats is fundamental. This work is a study based on a mobile agent-based approach that travels from host to host. A review of different threats to this particular model is presented. Throughout this work a detailed study is presented based on the migration protocol of the agents, which will be determined by using modeling tools such as Microsoft Modeling Tool (MMT) used in this case, to discover and detail each of the threats presented by this protocol. Additionally, an alternative as a solution according to a protocol that runs thanks to the implementation of hardware elements is proposed, which makes use of a TPM, thus determining which threats are mitigated or solved by implementing such hardware in conjunction with the protocol developed for this purpose. © 2021 ACM."

Therefore, this paper assesses literature on water-related human responses, the quantification and conceptualization methods and theories used, the scale at which models are applied, and the extent to which findings are used to make policy recommendations. We found system dynamics approaches mostly applied for policy evaluations, but of-ten with a limited integration of human behavior beyond water use; agent‐based models seem to be suited for policy analysis, but only limitedly applied for that purpose; and statistical studies to present the widest range of human responses and explanatory factors, but without making the behavioral mechanisms explicit.

The changes only affect the Milford Haven Waterway model test case and in particular they mainly affect the discussion around the model results in relation to the numbers of eels entering the outfall of Pembroke Power Station. Specifically, the discussion of the model results did not describe the presence of a high weir structure and strong flows at the outfall. Consequently several modifications have been made to the article, described below. The main modification has been to replace the final paragraph in the results section on page 15. The original short paragraph read as follows: It is noted that a lack of reliable in situ data on eel entrainment at the power station means these modelled entrainment rates cannot yet be confirmed. This has been replaced with: Once the eels reach the outfall it is unlikely that they are able to progress further due to the fast opposing flow speeds and the presence of a high weir. It should also be noted that the modelled rate of eel entrainment in the power station intake is simply a model result based on the assumptions made in this simulation. This rate cannot be verified from available survey data as the monitoring program agreed with the regulator does not target eel specifically. This is because the current eel protection measures at the intake are deemed adequate to prevent harmful entrainment or the impediment of free passage to eel. The abstract on page 1 has also been modified to reflect this change by the slightly modifying two sentences. The first modified sentence originally read as follows: The parameterised model is then used predictively at Milford Haven Waterway to investigate potential impacts on the juvenile eel population due to entrainment in a power plant cooling water intake and outfall. This was edited to include the words ‘attraction to the’ before the final word ‘outfall’ as follows: The parameterised model is then used predictively at Milford Haven Waterway to investigate potential impacts on the juvenile eel population due to entrainment in a power plant cooling water intake and attraction to the outfall. The penultimate sentence in the abstract has also been modified, which originally read: For the Milford Haven case study, the model predicted a juvenile eel intake and outfall entrainment rate of 2.0% and 4.7%, respectively. This has been modified to remove the implication that the eels swim into the outfall, as follows: For the Milford Haven case study, the model predicted a juvenile eel intake entrainment rate of 2.0% with 4.7% predicted to swim to the outfall.

This paper explores how the SES responds to PES intervention and investigates the role played by social networks in building resilience in a traditionally poverty-stricken area of China. The structure of social networks is measured through the social network analysis with degree and betweenness. Then, we develop an agent-based model to examine how social networks function to affect household livelihood resilience. The model captures feedbacks between PES intervention, social networks, household livelihood decisions, and environmental changes. Results show that the livelihood resilience of rural households is expected to decline during 2013–2030 within the current PES scheme. Social networks impose significant positive impacts on resilience building. However, their effects decay over time due to the fading structure and function of social networks along with massive rural-to-urban migration. Besides environmental conservation, policy-makers should take measures for socio-cultural conservation and preservation, reinforcing the identity, structure, and function within SESs for rural development in China. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

To reduce the risk, critical-sized bone defects are often treated with recombinant human BMP-2. Although enhanced bone tissue formation is observed when BMP-2 is administered locally to the defect, spatial and temporal distribution of callus tissue often differs from that found during regular bone healing or in defects treated differently. How this altered tissue patterning due to BMP-2 treatment is linked to mechano-biological principles at the cellular scale remains largely unknown. In this study, the mechano-biological regulation of BMP-2-treated critical-sized bone defect healing was investigated using a multiphysics multiscale in silico approach. Finite element and agent-based modeling techniques were combined to simulate healing within a critical-sized bone defect (5 mm) in a rat femur. Computer model predictions were compared to in vivo microCT data outcome of bone tissue patterning at 2, 4, and 6 weeks postoperation. In vivo, BMP-2 treatment led to complete healing through periosteal bone bridging already after 2 weeks postoperation. Computer model simulations showed that the BMP-2 specific tissue patterning can be explained by the migration of mesenchymal stromal cells to regions with a specific concentration of BMP-2 (chemotaxis). This study shows how computational modeling can help us to further understand the mechanisms behind treatment effects on compromised healing conditions as well as to optimize future treatment strategies. © 2021, The Author(s)."

Our proposed model analyzes the cost-benefit over a range of geographic regions and recommends the best capacity expansion area. We consider hospital bed numbers as a capacity determiner and population demographics for analyzing future demands economics in our approach. We divide a concerned geographic region into several sub-regions based on the local administrative body to recommend a sub-region where augmentation is necessary. The RL agent then works based on the age group, population growth, and current bed capacity utilizing the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm to minimize the cumulative cost.

While many experimental studies discussed the role of ECM in individual and collective cell migration, there are still unanswered questions about the impact of nonlocal cell sensing of other cells on the overall shape of tumour aggregation and its migration type. There are also unanswered questions about the migration and spread of tumour that arises at the boundary between different tissues with different collagen fibre orientations. To address these questions, in this study we develop a hybrid multi-scale model that considers the cells as individual entities and ECM as a continuous field. The numerical simulations obtained through this model match experimental observations, confirming that tumour aggregations are not moving if the ECM fibres are distributed randomly, and they only move when the ECM fibres are highly aligned. Moreover, the stationary tumour aggregations can have circular shapes or irregular shapes (with finger-like protrusions), while the moving tumour aggregations have elongate shapes (resembling to clusters, strands or files). We also show that the cell sensing radius impacts tumour shape only when there is a low ratio of fibre to non-fibre ECM components. Finally, we investigate the impact of different ECM fibre orientations corresponding to different tissues, on the overall tumour invasion of these neighbouring tissues. © Copyright © 2021 Suveges, Chamseddine, Rejniak, Eftimie and Trucu."

Collective tissue dynamics—understood as population behaviour arising from the interplay of the constituting discrete cells—can be studied with on- and off-lattice agent-based models. However, classical on-lattice agent-based models, also known as cellular automata, fail to replicate key aspects of collective migration, which is a central instance of collective behaviour in multicellular systems. To overcome drawbacks of classical on-lattice models, we introduce an on-lattice, agent-based modelling class for collective cell migration, which we call biological lattice-gas cellular automaton (BIO-LGCA). The BIO-LGCA is characterised by synchronous time updates, and the explicit consideration of individual cell velocities. While rules in classical cellular automata are typically chosen ad hoc, rules for cell-cell and cell-environment interactions in the BIO-LGCA can also be derived from experimental cell migration data or biophysical laws for individual cell migration. We introduce elementary BIO-LGCA models of fundamental cell interactions, which may be combined in a modular fashion to model complex multicellular phenomena. We exemplify the mathematical mean-field analysis of specific BIO-LGCA models, which allows to explain collective behaviour. The first example predicts the formation of clusters in adhesively interacting cells. The second example is based on a novel BIO-LGCA combining adhesive interactions and alignment. For this model, our analysis clarifies the nature of the recently discovered invasion plasticity of breast cancer cells in heterogeneous environments. Copyright: © 2021 Deutsch et al.

SA identifies assumptions that are particularly pivotal to the validation result, and in response model ruleset refinement resolves those assumptions in greater detail, balancing the sensitivity more evenly across the different assumptions and parameters. We implement and demonstrate our approach to refine agent-based models of forcibly displaced people in neighbouring countries. Over 70.8 million people are forcibly displaced worldwide, of which 26 million are refugees fleeing from armed conflicts, violence, natural disaster or famine. Predicting forced migration movements is important today, as it can help governments and NGOs to effectively assist vulnerable migrants and efficiently allocate humanitarian resources. We use an initial SA iteration to steer the simulation development process and identify several pivotal parameters. We then show that we are able to reduce the relative sensitivity of these parameters in a secondary SA iteration by approximately 54% on average.

We searched five bibliographic databases using two terminology categories: (1) migration or modern slavery terminology; (2) complex system methods terminology. Two reviewers conducted independent article screening. Peer-reviewed articles presenting original migration or modern slavery ABMs were included. Data extraction included model development steps and model characteristics. The dataset was synthesized and compared across studies. We identified 28 articles for inclusion. Many of the ABMs tested theories and about half were based on empirical data. Model development varied considerably and reported methods were extremely opaque. Only five studies used a structured development framework. The most common model involved agents deciding whether and where to migrate and attempting migration. Climate change was a common exogenous scenario modeled. Most of the ABMs did not undergo any sensitivity analysis or validation.ABM has a greater capacity to account for heterogeneous and dynamic decision-making than more frequently applied methods in research on migration and modern slavery. However, there is still a paucity of studies adopting ABM methods. These reviewed ABMs highlight gaps in the reporting and implementing of model development.

Choi, S. Bowles, Science 318, 636-640 (2007)]. The results of computational models are, however, sensitive to chosen parameter values and a deeper assessment of the plausibility of the parochial altruism hypothesis requires exploring this model in more detail. Here, I use a recently developed method to reexamine Choi and Bowles' model under a much broader range of conditions to those used in the original paper. Although the evolution of altruism is robust to perturbations in most of the default parameters, it is highly sensitive to group size and migration and to the lethality of war. The results show that the degree of genetic differentiation between groups (FST) produced by Choi and Bowles' original model is much greater than empirical estimates of FST between hunter-gatherer groups. When FST in the model is close to empirically observed values, altruism does not evolve. These results cast doubt on the importance of war in the evolution of human sociality. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved."

This framework is a four-step process, progressing from changes in individual behavior and/or physiology, to changes in individual health, then vital rates, and finally to population-level effects. Despite its simplicity, there are few complete PCoD models available for any marine mammal species due to a lack of data available to parameterize many of the steps. Here, we present an application of the PCoD framework for migrating humpback whales exposed to a simulated commercial seismic survey scenario. We approached the framework in two ways; first, progressing sequentially forwards through the steps and basing our assessment on lactating females. This cohort was considered to be the most vulnerable in terms of energetic costs of disturbance, and most likely to influence any change in population growth due to future breeding success. Field measurements of behavioral responses of migrating humpback whales to seismic air guns from a previous study were used to parameterize an agent-based model (ABM). This ABM was used to estimate the probability of response, where a response was defined as a change in the migratory movement of female-calf pairs, and the duration of any resulting delay in migration. We then estimated the energetic consequences of any delay in migration for the lactating females and created population growth models with which to assess any population-level effects. The results of the forwards approach suggested a low potential for population consequences of seismic surveys on migrating humpbacks. Working backwards through the framework, we investigated “worst case” scenarios that could potentially lead to a population-level effect. Here, we started with increasing calf mortality and assumed that an exposure time greater than 48 h would increase mortality risk. We determined the most likely context in which this exposure would occur (resting area) and then tested this context within an ABM. This backwards approach illustrates how the PCoD model can be used to make management decisions regarding animal populations and exposure to anthropogenic stressors. © Copyright © 2021 Dunlop, Braithwaite, Mortensen and Harris."

Analysis of the model dynamics can be challenging due to their inherent stochasticity and heavy computational requirements. Common approaches to the analysis of agent-based models include extensive Monte Carlo simulation of the model or the derivation of coarse-grained differential equation models to predict the expected or averaged output from the agent-based model. Both of these approaches have limitations, however, as extensive computation of complex agent-based models may be infeasible, and coarse-grained differential equation models can fail to accurately describe model dynamics in certain parameter regimes. We propose that methods from the equation learning field provide a promising, novel and unifying approach for agent-based model analysis. Equation learning is a recent field of research from data science that aims to infer differential equation models directly from data. We use this tutorial to review how methods from equation learning can be used to learn differential equation models from agent-based model simulations. We demonstrate that this framework is easy to use, requires few model simulations, and accurately predicts model dynamics in parameter regions where coarse-grained differential equation models fail to do so. We highlight these advantages through several case studies involving two agent-based models that are broadly applicable to biological phenomena: a birth-death-migration model commonly used to explore cell biology experiments and a susceptible-infected-recovered model of infectious disease spread. © 2021 The Author(s)."

Numerical models, substantiated with data from field and laboratory studies, can potentially predict and quantify the relative impacts of such activities, thereby assisting in the sustainable management of eel populations. Here, we present an agent-based model (ABM) of juvenile eel migration up estuaries. The model includes relevant eel behaviours and environmental conditions that, according to the literature, influence upstream migration. Crucially, by assessing the local salinity gradient and relative flow direction, the modelled eels (agents) self-determine whether the tide is flooding or ebbing and orientate themselves for navigation, with no top-down instructions. This allows the agents to decide which particular behaviour to undertake as part of Selective Tidal Stream Transport (STST). The developed ABM is coupled to a hydrodynamic model of the Thames Estuary and the results substantiated by comparison against eel trap data. Combinations of the various STST behaviours are systematically tested and the influence they have on up-estuary migration is assessed in terms of relative energy expenditure. The parameterised model is then used predictively at Milford Haven Waterway to investigate potential impacts on the juvenile eel population due to entrainment in a power plant cooling water intake and outfall. Results from the Thames model case study indicate that including bed anchoring behaviour is essential for achieving a good comparison with the eel trap data and the choice of salinity detection threshold is also important. If daylight avoidance (diel) behaviour is not included, the most energy efficient migration is achieved using just two STST behaviours (ebb tide bed anchoring and upward migration during flood). With diel behaviour included, energy expenditure is greater, but some efficiency is regained by including all of the STST behaviours. For the Milford Haven case study, the model predicted a juvenile eel intake and outfall entrainment rate of 2.0% and 4.7%, respectively. It is concluded that the ABM is a valuable tool for assessing potential impacts on the recruitment of eels (extendable to other species) and could be used to assist in site-selection and low impact design of energy infrastructure in tidal environments. © 2021 The Authors"

Here we present an agent-based model for simulating the emergence of the main biologic patterns found in melanocytic proliferations. Our model portrays the extracellular matrix of the dermo-epidermal junction as a two-dimensional manifold and we simulate cellular migration in terms of geometric translations driven by adhesive, repulsive and random forces. Abstracted cellular functions and melanocyte-matrix interactions are modeled as stochastic events. For identification and validation we use visual renderings of simulated cell populations in a horizontal perspective that reproduce growth patterns observed in vivo by sequential dermatoscopy and corresponding vertical views that reproduce the arrangement of melanocytes observed in histopathologic sections. Our results show that a balanced interplay of proliferation and migration produces the typical reticular pattern of nevi, whereas the globular pattern involves additional cellular mechanisms. We further demonstrate that slight variations in the three basic cellular properties proliferation, migration, and adhesion are sufficient to produce a large variety of morphological appearances of nevi. We anticipate our model to be a starting point for the reproduction of more complex scenarios that will help to establish functional connections between abstracted microscopic behavior and macroscopic patterns in all types of melanocytic proliferations including melanoma. © 2021 Schneckenreither et al."

As a rule, rapid change in the working-age population of any territory due to migration processes results in an imbalance in supply and demand on labour markets and a change in the demographic structure of the population. Migration is also to a large extent a reflection of socio-economic processes taking place in the society. Hence, the issues related to the study of migration factors, the direction, intensity and structure of migration flows, and the prediction of their magnitude are becoming topical issues these days. Mathematical tools are often used to analyze, predict migration processes and assess their consequences, allowing for essentially accurate modelling of migration processes for different territories on the basis of the available statistical data. In recent years, quite a number of scientific papers on modelling internal and external migration flows using mathematical methods have appeared both in Russia and in foreign countries in recent years. Consequently, there has been a need to systematize the currently most commonly used methods and tools applied in migration modelling to form a coherent picture of the main trends and research directions in this field. The presented review considers the main approaches to migration modelling and the main components of migration modelling methodology, i. e. stages, methods, models and model classification. Their comparative analysis was also conducted and general recommendations on the choice of mathematical tools for modelling were developed. The review contains two sections: migration modelling methods and migration models. The first section describes the main methods used in the model development process — econometric, cellular automata, system-dynamic, probabilistic, balance, optimization and cluster analysis. Based on the analysis of modern domestic and foreign publications on migration, the most common classes of models — regression, agent-based, simulation, optimization, probabilistic, balance, dynamic and combined — were identified and described. The features, advantages and disadvantages of different types of migration process models were considered. © 2021 Elena B. Oleynik, Natalya V. Ivashina, Yuriy D. Shmidt"

We explore the mechanisms that underpin the gut bacterial ecosystem and highlight how a more complete understanding of this ecology will enable improved intervention outcomes. This ecology varies within the gut over space and time. Interventions disrupt these processes, with cascading consequences throughout the ecosystem. In vivo studies cannot isolate and probe these processes at the required spatiotemporal resolutions, and in vitro studies lack the representative complexity required. However, we highlight that, together, both approaches can inform in silico models that integrate cellular-level dynamics, can extrapolate to explain bacterial community outcomes, permit experimentation and observation over ecological processes at high spatiotemporal resolution, and can serve as predictive platforms on which to prototype interventions.

Empirical data have repeatedly shown the bioregulatory importance of magnesium (Mg) ions in MSC growth and osteogenesis. In this study, we propose an agent-based model to predict the spatiotemporal dynamics of the MSC population and osteogenic differentiation in response to Mg2+ ions. A fuzzy-logic controller was designed to govern the decision-making process of cells by predicting four cellular processes of proliferation, differentiation, migration, and mortality in response to several important bioregulatory factors such as Mg2+ ions, pH, BMP2, and TGF-β1. The model was calibrated using the empirical data obtained from three sets of cell culture experiments. The model successfully reproduced the empirical observations regarding live cell count, viability, DNA content, and the differentiation-related markers of alkaline phosphate (ALP) and osteocalcin (OC). The simulation results, in agreement with the empirical data, showed that Mg2+ ions within 3–6 mM concentration have the highest stimulation effect on cell population growth. The model also correctly reproduced the stimulatory effect of Mg2+ ions on ALP and its inhibitory effect on OC as the early and late differentiation markers, respectively. Besides, the numerical simulation shed light on the innate cellular differences of the cells cultured in different experiments in terms of the proliferative capacity as well as sensitivity to Mg2+ ions. The proposed model can be adopted in the study of the osteogenesis around Mg-based implants where ions released due to degradation interact with local cells and regulate bone regeneration. © 2021 The Authors"

People’s decisions to move may depend on perceived levels of safety, accessibility or weather conditions; simulating this combination realistically requires a coupled approach. In this paper, we implement a multiscale simulation for the South Sudan conflict in 2016–2017 by defining a macroscale model covering most of South Sudan and a microscale model covering the region around the White Nile, which is in turn coupled to weather data from the Copernicus project. We couple these models cyclically in two different ways: using file I/O and using the MUSCLE3 coupling environment. For the microscale model, we incorporated weather factors including precipitation and river discharge datasets. To investigate the effects of the multiscale simulation and its coupling with weather data on refugees’ decisions to move and their speed, we compare the results with single-scale approaches in terms of the total validation error, total execution time and coupling overhead. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

The motivation of this work is to develop an agent-based model (ABM) to capture the existence of such migrant and refugee flows, and to explore the effects of these flows on urban dynamics. Advances in agent-based modelling have led to theoretically-grounded spatial agent models of urban dynamics, capturing the dynamics of population, property prices, and regeneration. In this article we leverage such an extant agent-based model founded on the rent-gap theory, as a lens to study the effect of sizeable refugee migration upon a capital city in West Asia. In order to calibrate and validate the simulation model we construct indices for housing prices and other factors. Results from the model, implemented in NetLogo, show the impact of migration shock on the housing market, and identify the relative efficacy of housing intervention policies.

Several animals have the ability to use the inclination or tilt of magnetic field lines as a component of a magnetic compass sense that can be used to maintain migratory headings. In addition, a few animals are able to distinguish among different inclination angles and, in effect, exploit inclination as a surrogate for latitude. Little is known, however, about the role that magnetic inclination plays in guiding long-distance migrations. In this paper, we use an agent-based modelling approach to investigate whether an artificial agent can successfully execute a series of transequatorial migrations by using sequential measurements of magnetic inclination. The agent was tested with multiple navigation strategies in both present-day and reversed magnetic fields. The findings (i) demonstrate that sequential inclination measurements can enable migrations between the northern and southern hemispheres, and (ii) demonstrate that an inclination-based strategy can tolerate a reversed magnetic field, which could be useful in the development of autonomous engineered systems that must be robust to magnetic field changes. The findings also appear to be consistent with the results of some animal navigation experiments, although whether any animal exploits a strategy of using sequential measurements of inclination remains unknown. © 2021 The Author(s)."

This is further complicated by the fact that associated data pertaining to such migration are largely incomplete or untrustworthy. In view of the shortcomings in respect of modelling instances of conflict and the lack of data related to the associated movement patterns of forcibly displaced individuals, a generic framework is proposed for aiding in the design of agent-based models for simulating conflict instances along with the localised decision-making processes underlying the movement of refugees, undocumented migrants and internally displaced persons fleeing conflict-affected areas. A concept demonstrator is developed based on the framework in an attempt to demonstrate the usefulness and practicability of the framework in the context of conflict-induced forced migration in Syria. The value of such a model lies in the fact that it produces as output the corresponding emergent large-scale migration patterns which may assist in understanding the movement patterns of forcibly displaced people and predicting anticipated destinations of these individuals, and serve as a decision support tool for humanitarian relief. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"

The model encompasses the role of cell migration and adhesion, the influence of the extracellular matrix, the effects of oxygen and nutrient availability, and the signalling triggered by chemical cues and growth factors. The proposed in silico hybrid modelling framework combines successfully the advantages of continuum-based and discrete methods, namely the finite element and agent-based method respectively. The framework is thus used to realistically model cancer mechano-biology in a multiscale fashion while maintaining the resolution power of each method in a computationally cost-effective manner. The model is tailored to simulate glioma progression, and is subsequently used to interrogate the balance between the host cells and small sized gliomas, while the go-or-grow phenotype characteristic in glioblastomas is also investigated. Also, cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions are examined with respect to their effect in (macroscopic) tumour growth, brain tissue perfusion and tumour necrosis.

Here, we present such a process alongside its five building blocks: an agent-based simulation of migration route formation, resembling the recent asylum migration to Europe; an evaluation framework for migration data; psychological experiments eliciting decisions under uncertainty; the choice of a programming language and modelling formalisms; and statistical analysis with Bayesian meta-modelling based on Gaussian Process assumptions and experimental design principles.

A commonly used model for network morphogenesis proposes that sprouts develop through interactions between leader (tip) cells and follower (stalk) cells. In this description, tip cells emerge from existing structures, travel up chemoattractant gradients, and form new networks by guiding the movement of stalk cells. Such dynamics have been mathematically represented by continuum ""snail-trail""models in which the tip cell flux contributes to the stalk cell proliferation rate. Although snail-trail models constitute a classical depiction of leader-follower behavior, their accuracy has yet to be evaluated in a rigorous quantitative setting. Here, we extend the snail-trail modeling framework to two spatial dimensions by introducing a novel multiplicative factor to the stalk cell rate equation, which corrects for neglected network creation in directions other than that of the migrating front. Our derivation of this factor demonstrates that snail-trail models are valid descriptions of cell dynamics when chemotaxis dominates cell movement. We confirm that our snail-trail model accurately predicts the dynamics of tip and stalk cells in an existing agent-based model (ABM) for network formation [Pillay et al., Phys. Rev. E 95, 012410 (2017)10.1103/PhysRevE.95.012410]. We also derive conditions for which it is appropriate to use a reduced, one-dimensional snail-trail model to analyze ABM results. Our analysis identifies key metrics for cell migration that may be used to anticipate when simple snail-trail models will accurately describe experimentally observed cell dynamics in network formation. © 2020 American Physical Society."

An underlying assumption of these applications is that tissues grown at the same site share a similar isotopic signal, representative of the location of their origin. However, large variations in tissue isotopic compositions often exist even among conspecific individuals within local populations, which complicates origin and migration inferences. Field-data and correlation analyses have provided hints about the underlying mechanisms of within-site among-individual isotopic variance, but a theory explaining the causes and magnitude of such variance has not been established. Here we develop a mechanistic modeling framework that provides explicit predictions of the magnitude, patterns, and drivers of isotopic variation among individuals living in a common but environmentally heterogeneous habitat. The model toolbox includes isoscape models of environmental isotopic variability, an agent-based model of behavior and movement, and a physiology-biochemistry model of isotopic incorporation into tissues. We compare model predictions against observed variation in hatch-year individuals of the songbird Spotted Towhee (Pipilo maculatus) in Red Butte Canyon, Utah, and evaluate the ability of the model to reproduce this variation under different sets of assumptions. Only models that account for environmental isotopic variability predict a similar magnitude of isotopic variation as observed. Within the modeling framework, behavioral rules and properties govern how animals nesting in different locations acquire resources from different habitats, and birds nesting in or near riparian habitat preferentially access isotopically lighter resources than those associated with the meadow and slope habitats, which results in more negative body water and tissue isotope values. Riparian nesters also have faster body water turnover and acquire more water from drinking (vs. from food), which exerts a secondary influence on their isotope ratios. Thus, the model predicts that local among-individual isotopic variance is linked first to isotopic heterogeneity in the local habitat, and second to how animals sample this habitat during foraging. Model predictions provide insight into the fundamental mechanisms of small-scale isotopic variance and can be used to predict the utility of isotope-based methods for specific groups or environments in ecological and forensic research. © Copyright © 2020 Magozzi, Vander Zanden, Wunder, Trueman, Pinney, Peers, Dennison, Horns, Şekercioğlu and Bowen."

Environmental, interpersonal, and transactional variables such as vegetation and water availability, conflict, ethnic tensions, and private/public land delineation influence the movements of these populations. The challenges of climate change and conflict are widely felt by nomadic pastoralists in Somalia, where resources are scarce, natural disasters are increasingly common, and protracted conflict has plagued communities for decades. Bereft of real-time data, researchers and programmatic personnel often turn to post hoc analysis to understand the interaction between climate, conflict, and migration, and design programs to address the needs of nomadic pastoralists. By designing an Agent-Based Model to simulate the movement of nomadic pastoralists based on typologically-diverse, historical data of environmental, interpersonal, and transactional variables in Somaliland and Puntland between 2008 and 2018, this study explores how pastoralists respond to changing environments. Through subsequent application of spatial analysis such as choropleth maps, kernel density mapping, and standard deviational ellipses, we characterize the resultant pastoralist population distribution in response to these variables. Outcomes demonstrate a large scale spatio-temporal trend of pastoralists migrating to the southeast of the study area with high density areas in the south of Nugaal, the northwest of Sool, and along the Ethiopian border. While minimal inter-seasonal variability is seen, multiple analyses support the consolidation of pastoralists to specifically favorable regions. Exploration of the large-scale population, climate, and conflict trends allows for cogent narratives and associative hypotheses regarding the pastoralist migration during the study period. While this model produces compelling associations between pastoralist movements and terrestrial and conflict variables, it relies heavily on assumptions and incomplete data that are not necessarily representative of realities on the ground. Given the paucity of data regarding pastoralist decision-making and migration, validation remains challenging. Copyright: © 2020 Nelson et al.

Urban management policy must be supported by a comprehensive recognition of bottom-up processes of socio-demographic changes and migration, both throughout the city and in individual districts. Post-war housing estates consistently play a significant role in Polish cities. Maintaining their currently good status, combined with suppression of decline processes, will be one of the biggest challenges of contemporary urban planning and regeneration programmes. The first housing estates are entering a dynamic phase of social and demographic changes that can determine the future development of the city. This article describes the process of collecting and systematizing data on residents and the use of such data to create a virtual model of a large housing estate. The structure of the agent-based model and its modules, using the individuality of the residents and the households in connection with the architectural structure of the housing estate, is presented. In addition, the key information from simulations for the Wrocław Popowice estate were extracted in order to highlight the model's usefulness in providing valuable information about bottom-up processes occurring in the local community.

While the inflammatory response varies in different tissue types, under disease and in response to therapeutic interventions, it has common interactions that occur between immune cells and inflammatory mediators. Understanding these underlying inflammatory mechanisms is key in progressing treatments and therapies for numerous inflammatory conditions. It is now considered that constituent mechanisms of the inflammatory response can be actively manipulated in order to drive resolution of inflammatory damage; particularly, those mechanisms related to the pro-inflammatory role of neutrophils and the anti-inflammatory role of macrophages. In this article, we describe the assembly of a hybrid mathematical model in which the spatial spread of inflammatory mediators is described through partial differential equations, and immune cells (neutrophils and macrophages) are described individually via an agent-based modelling approach. We pay close attention to how immune cells chemotax toward pro-inflammatory mediators, presenting a model for cell chemotaxis that is calibrated against experimentally observed cell trajectories in healthy and COPD-affected scenarios. We illustrate how variations in key model parameters can drive the switch from resolution of inflammation to chronic outcomes, and show that aberrant neutrophil chemotaxis can move an otherwise healthy outcome to one of chronicity. Finally, we reflect on our results in the context of the on-going hunt for new therapeutic interventions. © 2020 Bayani et al.

In this paper, the life cycle and movement of the mauve stinger, Pelagia noctiluca, is simulated from fertilized egg up to the adult stage using an individual-based model (IBM). Our model combines available knowledge on the mauve stinger with inputs of ocean currents and temperature from the CMEMS hydrodynamic model. Horizontal transport is solely governed by ocean currents, but vertical distribution is controlled by diel vertical migration, motility and stage of development. Particle agents are released along the submarine canyons in the Spanish Mediterranean waters during the spring reproduction period, to later disperse and develop through an interplay between physical and biological processes.

Collective cell motion of eukaryotic cells often includes interactions that result in polar alignment of cell velocities, while bacterial patterns typically show features of apolar velocity alignment. For analysing the population-scale effects of these different alignment mechanisms, various on- and off-lattice agent-based models have been introduced. However, discriminating model-specific artefacts from general features of collective cell motion is challenging. In this work, we focus on equivalence criteria at the population level to compare on- and off-lattice models. In particular, we define prototypic off- and on-lattice models of polar and apolar alignment, and show how to obtain an on-lattice from an off-lattice model of velocity alignment. By characterizing the behaviour and dynamical description of collective migration models at the macroscopic level, we suggest the type of phase transitions and possible patterns in the approximative macroscopic partial differential equation descriptions as informative equivalence criteria between on- and off-lattice models.

This topic is here tackled by a discrete model. Entering in more details, each agent, represented by a material point, is assumed to move following a first-order Newtonian law, which distinguishes speed and orientation. In particular, the latter results from the balance of a given set of behavioural stimuli, each of them defined by a direction and a weight, that quantifies its relative importance. A constraint on the sum of the weights then avoids implausible simultaneous maximization/minimization of all movement traits. Our framework is based on a minimal set of rules and parameters and is able to capture and classify a number of collective group dynamics emerging from different individual preferred behaviour, which possibly includes attractive, repulsive and alignment stimuli. In the case of a system of animals subjected only to the first two behavioural inputs, we also show how analytical arguments allow us to a priori relate the equilibrium interparticle spacing to critical model coefficients.

However, increasing resistance to insecticides threatens to undermine these efforts. Understanding the evolution and propagation of resistance is thus imperative to mitigating loss of intervention effectiveness. Additionally, accelerated research and development of new tools that can be deployed alongside existing vector control strategies is key to eradicating malaria in the near future. Methods such as gene drives that aim to genetically modify large mosquito populations in the wild to either render them refractory to malaria or impair their reproduction may prove invaluable tools. Mathematical models of gene flow in populations, which is the transfer of genetic information from one population to another through migration, can offer invaluable insight into the behavior and potential impact of gene drives as well as the spread of insecticide resistance in the wild. Here, we present the first multi-locus, agent-based model of vector genetics that accounts for mutations and a many-to-many mapping cardinality of genotypes to phenotypes to investigate gene flow, and the propagation of gene drives in Anopheline populations. This model is embedded within a large scale individual-based model of malaria transmission representative of a high burden, high transmission setting characteristic of the Sahel. Results are presented for the selection of insecticide-resistant vectors and the spread of resistance through repeated deployment of insecticide treated nets (ITNs), in addition to scenarios where gene drives act in concert with existing vector control tools such as ITNs. The roles of seasonality, spatial distribution of vector habitat and feed sites, and existing vector control in propagating alleles that confer phenotypic traits via gene drives that result in reduced transmission are explored. The ability to model a spectrum of vector species with different genotypes and phenotypes in the context of malaria transmission allows us to test deployment strategies for existing interventions that reduce the deleterious effects of resistance and allows exploration of the impact of new tools being proposed or developed.

While numerous theories have been forwarded as to why such situations occur, it has remained difficult to empirically test the relative impact of the many interacting processes that produce segmentation in the labor market. In this article, we investigate the processes of ethnic segmentation in low-skilled labor markets, where referral hiring is the norm, with particular reference to the role of ethnically homogeneous social networks and forms of discrimination. We employ an agent-based modeling approach, adapting key elements from Waldinger and Lichter’s widely cited networked explanation of ethnic labor market segmentation. This approach allows us to provide a different lens on theories of ethnic labor market segmentation, investigating the relative impacts of different causal processes that are difficult to investigate in this way using other social science approaches. The overall results from our model indicate that ethnically homogeneous social networks have the effect of increasing the level of ethnic segmentation within a referral-based labor market, but that these networks also help immigrant populations grow and protect them from the negative impacts of employer discrimination. Furthermore, these networks have a greater impact on labor market segmentation than discrimination alone. In conclusion, this sociologically informed agent-based model provides important insights into the manner and extent in which changes in social conditions may affect population-level phenomena. © The Author(s) 2018."

Under favorable environmental conditions flightless juveniles may aggregate into coherent, aligned swarms referred to as hopper bands. These bands are often observed as a propagating wave having a dense front with rapidly decreasing density in the wake. A tantalizing and common observation is that these fronts slow and steepen in the presence of green vegetation. This suggests the collective motion of the band is mediated by resource consumption. Our goal is to model and quantify this effect. We focus on the Australian plague locust, for which excellent field and experimental data is available. Exploiting the alignment of locusts in hopper bands, we concentrate solely on the density variation perpendicular to the front. We develop two models in tandem; an agent-based model that tracks the position of individuals and a partial differential equation model that describes locust density. In both these models, locust are either stationary (and feeding) or moving. Resources decrease with feeding. The rate at which locusts transition between moving and stationary (and vice versa) is enhanced (diminished) by resource abundance. This effect proves essential to the formation, shape, and speed of locust hopper bands in our models. From the biological literature we estimate ranges for the ten input parameters of our models. Sobol sensitivity analysis yields insight into how the band's collective characteristics vary with changes in the input parameters. By examining 4.4 million parameter combinations, we identify biologically consistent parameters that reproduce field observations. We thus demonstrate that resource-dependent behavior can explain the density distribution observed in locust hopper bands. This work suggests that feeding behaviors should be an intrinsic part of future modeling efforts. Copyright © 2020 Bernoff et al."

These new blood vessels allow tumors to continue to grow beyond what the pre-existing vasculature could support. Here, we construct a mathematical model to simulate tumor angiogenesis by considering each endothelial cell as an agent, and allowing the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nutrient fields to impact the dynamics and phenotypic transitions of each tumor and endothelial cell. The phenotypes of the endothelial cells (i.e., tip, stalk, and phalanx cells) are selected by the local VEGF field, and govern the migration and growth of vessel sprouts at the cellular level. Over time, these vessels grow and migrate to the tumor, forming anastomotic loops to supply nutrients, while interacting with the tumor through mechanical forces and the consumption of VEGF. The model is able to capture collapsing and breaking of vessels caused by tumor-endothelial cell interactions. This is accomplished through modeling the physical interaction between the vasculature and the tumor, resulting in vessel occlusion and tumor heterogeneity over time due to the stages of response in angiogenesis. Key parameters are identified through a sensitivity analysis based on the Sobol method, establishing which parameters should be the focus of subsequent experimental efforts. During the avascular phase (i.e., before angiogenesis is triggered), the nutrient consumption rate, followed by the rate of nutrient diffusion, yield the greatest influence on the number and distribution of tumor cells. Similarly, the consumption and diffusion of VEGF yield the greatest influence on the endothelial and tumor cell numbers during angiogenesis. In summary, we present a hybrid mathematical approach that characterizes vascular changes via an agent-based model, while treating nutrient and VEGF changes through a continuum model. The model describes the physical interaction between a tumor and the surrounding blood vessels, explicitly allowing the forces of the growing tumor to influence the nutrient delivery of the vasculature.

Such models require the accurate depiction of the jurisdiction’s population over extended time periods to enable modeling of the development of non-communicable diseases under consideration of historical, sociodemographic developments. We developed CASCADEPOP to provide a readily available sociodemographic micro-synthesis and microsimulation platform for US populations. The micro-synthesis method used iterative proportional fitting to integrate data from the US Census, the American Community Survey, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, Multiple Cause of Death Files, and several national surveys to produce a synthetic population aged 12 to 80 years on 01/01/1980 for five states (California, Minnesota, New York, Tennessee, and Texas) and the US. Characteristics include individuals’ age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital/employment/parental status, education, income and patterns of alcohol use as an exemplar health behavior. The microsimulation simulates individuals’ sociodemographic life trajectories over 35 years to 31/12/2015 accounting for population developments including births, deaths, and migration. Results comparing the 1980 micro-synthesis against observed data shows a successful depiction of state and US population characteristics and of drinking. Comparing the microsimulation over 30 years with Census data also showed the successful simulation of sociodemographic developments. The CASCADEPOP platform enables modelling of health behaviors across individuals’ life courses and at a population level. As it contains a large number of relevant sociodemographic characteristics it can be further developed by researchers to build US agent-based models and microsimulations to examine health behaviors, interventions, and policies. © 2020, Brennan et al."

In this article, we coupled a mathematical model of animal-mosquito interactions with an agent-based model describing the migrations of hosts between cities. The mathematical model describes animal-mosquito interactions in each city and the agent based-model describes the migrations of animals between cities. The coupled model allows to compute at each time the number of infected animals in all cities and to study the impact of host migrations on the dynamics of infections. The obtained results showed that quarantining certain cities can reduce the number of infected hosts. It is also observed that when the density of animal migrations increases, the number of infection cases increases. The developed model brings solutions to both models (mathematical model and agent-based model) limits. This model could help to study and forecasting the Rift Valley Fever transmission and its outbreak in the short and long term. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

In the specific case of migration using the United States-Mexico border, it is difficult to understand the patterns and uncertainty that comes from trying to capture the behavior of individuals and groups. Migrants using the U.S.Mexico border present features and migration patterns that are unique, particularly in the case of group migrations, structured social networks, and caravans that travel towards the border together. We build an agent-based model (ABM) that simulates migrant decision-making of which border to choose, to test the effects of social influence on an agent's migration strategy, as well as the effects of policy changes on migrant behavior. Deciphering these emerging patterns of migration and social phenomena can help provide researchers and policymakers with an added dimension of knowledge on how to better utilize resources at the U.S. ports of entry. © 2020 Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS)"

Observing their successful use in traveling salesman problem and K-means clustering, we promote this trend in ABM to distributed data analysis. Our approach is to populate reactive agents on a distributed, structured dataset and to have them discover the dataset’s attributes (e.g., the shortest routes and the best cluster centroids) through agent migration and interaction. We implemented this agent-based approach with the multi-agent spatial simulation (MASS) library and identified programming features for agents to best achieve data discovery. Of importance is ease of describing when and how to have agents traverse a graph, ramble over an array, and share the on-going computational states. We have responded to this question with two agent-descriptivity enhancements: (1) event-driven agent behavioral execution and (2) direct inter-agent broadcast. The former automatically schedules agent actions before and after agent migration, whereas the latter informs all agents of up-to-date global information, (e.g., the best slate of centroids so far).

Eel passes, narrow sloping channels lined with substrata that enable elvers to ascend, are one way to mitigate against these barriers. Currently, studded eel tiles are a popular substrate. This study is the first to evaluate the flow fields within studded eel tiles and to model the swimming performance of elvers using cellular automata (CA) and individual- (or agent-) based models. Velocities and flow depths predicted by a computational fluid dynamics model of studded eel tiles are first validated against published values for a single installation angle-discharge combination. The validated model is then used to compute three-dimensional flow fields for eel passes at five different installation angles and three inflow discharges. CA and individual-based models are employed to assess upstream passage efficiency for a range of elver sizes. The individual-based model approximates measured passage efficiencies better than the CA model. Passage efficiency is greatest for shallow slopes, low discharges and large elvers. Results are synthesized into an easy-to-understand graphic to help practitioners improve eel pass designs. © 2020 The Authors.

In addition, PES literature is short of ecological metrics that document the consequences of PES other than land use and land cover and its change. Building on detailed survey data from Fanjingshan National Nature Reserve (FNNR), China, we developed and tested an agent-based model to study the complex interactions among human livelihoods (migration and resource extraction in particular), PES, and the Guizhou golden monkey habitat occupancy over 20 years. We then performed simulation-based experiments testing social and ecological impacts of PES payments as well as human population pressures. The results show that with a steady increase in out-migration, the number of land parcels enrolled in one of China’s major PES programs tends to increase, reach a peak, and then slowly decline, showing a convex trend that converges to a stable number of enrolled parcels regardless of payment levels. Simulated monkey occupancy responds to changes in PES payment levels substantially in edge areas of FNNR. Our model is not only useful for FNNR, but also applicable as a platform to study and further understand human and ecological roles of PES in many other complex human-environment systems, shedding light into key elements, interactions, or relationships in the systems that PES researchers and practitioners should bear in mind. Our research contributes to establishing a scientific basis of PES science that incorporates features in complex systems, offering more realistic, spatially and temporally explicit insights related to PES policy or related interventions. © 2020, University of Surrey.

In real ecosystems, the capacity of patch is finite. If a patch is already occupied by the individuals of some species, then the migration into the patch is impossible. For the migration, empty cells are necessary in the destination patch (“nonlinear migration”). In the present article, we deal with two-patch system composed of prey and ambush predator. Preys can migrate between both patches, but predators stay in a single patch. Agent-based model (ABM) is applied in respective patches. Each patch contains a finite number of cells; “capacity” of a patch is defined by the total cell number in the patch. Each cell is either empty or occupied with prey or predator. Reaction-migration equations are presented for non-spatial system of ABM. Both non-spatial and spatial models indicate that the population dynamics are largely affected by the finiteness of respective patches. In particular, we find a self-organized habitat segregation, depending on parameter values. The prey density becomes nearly zero in the predator patch, although many preys live in non-predator patch. Although the migration occurs between both patches, the prey almost disappears in one patch. Such a segregation may be caused by the finite capacity of patches. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."

We present the agent-based model of regional human resource dynamics. The model reflects sex-age structure, composition of households and spatial distribution of population; production; educational and administrative institutions in the region providing realization of the Program. To simulate social activity of the population in the agent-based model we need information about their reaction on the Program events. Within the survey we collect and process information about satisfaction with financial situation, desire to change job or region of residence of respondents in different clusters. Simulation on the basis of the agent-based model would show how these factors affect individual decisions and, consequently, size and structure of the regional human resource. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

During embryogenesis, neural crest cells undergo coordinated epithelial to mesenchymal transformations and migrate towards various forming organs. Here we develop a computational model to understand how mutual interactions between migrating neural crest cells (NCs) and the surrounding population of placode cells (PCs) generate coordinated migration. According to experimental findings, we implement a minimal set of hypotheses, based on a coupling between chemotactic movement of NCs in response to a placode-secreted chemoattractant (Sdf1) and repulsion induced from contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL), triggered by heterotypic NC–PC contacts. This basic set of assumptions is able to semi-quantitatively recapitulate experimental observations of the characteristic multispecies phenomenon of “chase-and-run”, where the colony of NCs chases an evasive PC aggregate. The model further reproduces a number of in vitro manipulations, including full or partial disruption of NC chemotactic migration and selected mechanisms coordinating the CIL phenomenon. Finally, we provide various predictions based on altering other key components of the model mechanisms. © 2019, The Author(s)."

Complexity of the wound healing process and the need for improved therapeutics necessitate a better understanding of the biochemical cues that drive fibrosis.

The ABM computes information about cytokine and growth factor levels in the environment including TGFβ, TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6, which are passed as inputs to the LDE model. The LDE model then computes the network signaling state of individual cardiac fibroblasts within the ABM. Based on the current network state, fibroblasts make decisions regarding cytokine secretion and deposition and degradation of collagen. Simulated fibroblasts respond dynamically to rapidly changing extracellular environments and contribute to spatial heterogeneity in model predicted fibrosis, which is governed by many parameters including cell density, cell migration speeds, and cytokine levels. Verification tests confirmed that predictions of the coupled model and network model alone were consistent in response to constant cytokine inputs and furthermore, a subset of coupled model predictions were validated with in vitro experiments with human cardiac fibroblasts. This multiscale framework for cardiac fibrosis will allow for systematic screening of the effects of molecular perturbations in fibroblast signaling on tissue-scale extracellular matrix composition and organization. © Copyright © 2019 Rikard, Athey, Nelson, Christiansen, Lee, Holmes, Peirce and Saucerman."

Urbanization is resource centric, which involves, large-scale transformation of the landscape with the irreversible impacts on the regional ecology, hydrology, and environment, which is evident from large-scale land cover changes leading to deforestation, encroachment of lakes/water bodies, forest, and farmlands, conversion of agriculture landscapes, etc. damaging the environs. Visualization of urban growth based on the past spatial patterns would help in evolving appropriate policy framework towards the design of sustainable cites for the prudent management of natural resources. Current communication attempts to understand the landscape dynamics along the proposed Mumbai–Pune industrial corridor (with 10 km buffer) through (i) rule-based/non agent-based models (non-ABM) and (ii) agent-based models (ABM) with the evaluation of relative performance of ABM and non-ABM methods. Comparative assessment of the model performance through accuracy assessment and Kappa (relatively significant at p < 0.05) indicates the superior performance of the agent-based model approaches due to its interaction with factors and constraints that allow urban growth in the region. Non-ABM model predicted the growth of 49.69% by 2027 with the decline of vegetation to 9.63%. Compared to this, agent-based model predicted growth in urban landscape to 47.12% and the decline of vegetation to 11.10%. The current research was formulated based on the recommendations of the deliberation between academia and stakeholder industries that are likely to be benefitted by the implementation of the industrial corridor.

To reduce the risk to biodiversity, there is a need for connected, interjurisdictional landscape management plans at regional levels. It is a key to identify how decision-makers collaborate and share knowledge, learn, and ultimately make decisions affecting species coexistence. Here, we present a model that mimics multiple political jurisdictions making decisions affecting species migration across a landscape. This management and species movement can be between nations, between public and private landowners, or any other scale of interjurisdictional management in between. The model we present here has direct application to the decisions that managers make regularly and draws upon anecdotal evidence from real-world case studies such as the removal of fences in the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park in southern Africa, and cooperation to solve regional environmental dilemmas in Arizona between neighbors. Our results highlight the importance of social learning and networks and matching the scale of sociopolitical and ecological processes in order to reduce biodiversity loss. Further, we find that close-knit decision-makers, especially when learning/imitating management strategies the same way, are detrimental to countering biodiversity loss. Finally, our results indicate the importance of allowing decision-makers to have room for experimental, individual learning to broaden the set of management strategies existing within a system to reduce biodiversity loss. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Although cyber-physical production systems (CPPS) provide the means to cope with complexity and flexibility, the migration with existing control systems is still a challenge. The term CPPS denotes a mechatronic system (physical world) coupled with software entities and digital information (cyber part), both enabling the smart factory concept for the Industry 4.0 (I4.0) paradigm. In this regard, design patterns could help developers to build their software with common solutions for manufacturing control derived from experiences. We provide a description and comparison of the already existing multi-agent systems (MAS) design patterns, which were collected and classified by introducing two classification criteria to support MAS developers. The applicability of these criteria is shown in the case of specific example architectures from the lower and higher control levels. The authors, together with experts from the German Agent Systems committee FA 5.15, gathered more than twenty MAS patterns, evaluated, and compared four selected patterns with the presented criteria and terminology. The main contribution is a CPPS architecture that fulfills requirements related to the era of smart factories, as well as the Reference Architectural Model I4.0 (RAMI 4.0). The conclusions indicate that agent-based patterns greatly benefit the CPPS design.

The coordination between leader cell and follower cell affects the rate of collective cell migration. However, there are still very few papers on the impacts of the stimulus signal released by the leader on the follower. Tracking cell movement using 3D time-lapse microscopy images provides an unprecedented opportunity to systematically study and analyze collective cell migration. Results: Recently, deep reinforcement learning algorithms have become very popular. In our paper, we also use this method to train the number of cells and control signals. By experimenting with single-follower cell and multi-follower cells, it is concluded that the number of stimulation signals is proportional to the rate of collective movement of the cells. Such research provides a more diverse approach and approach to studying biological problems. Conclusion: Traditional research methods are always based on real-life scenarios, but as the number of cells grows exponentially, the research process is too time consuming. Agent-based modeling is a robust framework that approximates cells to isotropic, elastic, and sticky objects. In this paper, an agent-based modeling framework is used to establish a simulation platform for simulating collective cell migration. The goal of the platform is to build a biomimetic environment to demonstrate the importance of stimuli between the leading and following cells. © 2019 The Author(s)."

Experimental observations, however, show that this assumption is often far from the real cell cycle time distribution (CCTD). Recent studies have suggested an alternative approach to modelling cell proliferation based on a multi-stage representation of the CCTD. In this paper we investigate the connection between the CCTD and the speed of the collective invasion. We first state a result for a general CCTD, which allows the computation of the invasion speed using the Laplace transform of the CCTD. We use this to deduce the range of speeds for the general case. We then focus on the more realistic case of multi-stage models, using both a stochastic agent-based model and a set of reaction-diffusion equations for the cells’ average density. By studying the corresponding travelling wave solutions, we obtain an analytical expression for the speed of invasion for a general N-stage model with identical transition rates, in which case the resulting cell cycle times are Erlang distributed. We show that, for a general N-stage model, the Erlang distribution and the exponential distribution lead to the minimum and maximum invasion speed, respectively. This result allows us to determine the range of possible invasion speeds in terms of the average proliferation time for any multi-stage model. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

The reproduction of fish producing semi-buoyant eggs requires a specific hydrodynamic condition. To predict the influence of cascade hydropower development on the reproductive process of fish with semi-buoyant eggs, a MIKE 21 Flow Model was applied. Lagrangian particle tracking was used to simulate the movement of semi-buoyant eggs and larvae using the Agent-based Modeling (ABM) lab module. The calibrated model showed good agreement between the simulated and observed data for the hydrodynamic process in the reservoir. Twelve scenarios were defined to fully understand whether fish with semi-buoyant eggs can reproduce naturally. The results showed the following: (1) It is difficult to form a fish migration passage in the reservoir in all potential scenarios. (2) Semi-buoyant eggs and larvae sank to the bottom and perished before they hatched and were old enough to survive, since the hydrodynamic conditions could not meet the minimum flow velocity required to keep them in the drift. (3) Even if the hydrodynamic conditions can keep them in the drift in impossible high-discharge conditions, there was not enough drifting time and distance in the reservoir. The results implied that fishes with semi-buoyant eggs cannot reproduce naturally in the main stream, but it is possible that they can reproduce successfully after the protection of the tributary. The method is transferrable to other locations via establishment of models with relevant data to a particular area. © 2019"

One of the challenges in coupling ABM to FEM is that these two domains typically employ grid or element sizes that differ by several orders of magnitude. Here, we develop and demonstrate an interpolation-based method for mapping between ABM and FEM domains of different resolutions that is suitable for linear and nonlinear FEM meshes and balances accuracy with computational demands. We then explore the effects of refining the FEM mesh and the ABM grid in the setting of a fully coupled model. ABM grid refinement studies showed unexpected effects of grid size whenever cells were present at a high enough density for crowding to affect proliferation and migration. In contrast to an FE-only model, refining the FE mesh in the coupled model increased strain differences between adjacent finite elements. Allowing strain-dependent feedback on collagen turnover magnified the effects of regional heterogeneity, producing highly nonlinear spatial and temporal responses. Our results suggest that the choice of both ABM grid and FEM mesh density in coupled models must be guided by experimental data and accompanied by careful grid and mesh refinement studies in the individual domains as well as the fully coupled model. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Several studies suggest that malaria persistence in the area can be connected with a high prevalence of asymptomatic infections, which were subsequently shown to be connected with work-related exposure in areas of hyperendemic transmission. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the infection reservoir represented by asymptomatic carriers in the northern Peruvian Amazon, combined with circular human movement to and from hyperendemic working areas, can capture the observed hypoendemic malaria transmission. Methods: We designed a set of agent-based models that represent local-scale malaria transmission in a typical riverine community in the northern Peruvian Amazon. The models include asymptomatic individuals as well as a full representation of human movements within the community and between the community and external hyperendemic working places. Several theoretical scenarios are explored to verify if and how malaria clinical immunity prevalence and human work-related movements influence the malaria morbidity registered in the community. Results: Agent-based simulations suggest that malaria incidence observed through passive case detection can be reproduced as exclusively generated by the asymptomatic infection reservoir. Scenarios analysis also show that, even if asymptomatic infections are completely eliminated, human movements to and from hyperendemic working areas generate a flow of imported cases that is enough to permit the persistence of transmission in the community. Simulation results were verified over a wide range of clinical immunity prevalence values and over a wide range of percentages of people working in remote hyperendemic areas. This context of unstable malaria transmission is observed to be vulnerable to severe outbreaks. Conclusions: Asymptomatic malaria infection and occupational circular human movement to hyperendemic transmission areas are designated by agent-based models as possible exclusive causes of residual hypoendemic malaria transmission observed in the Peruvian Amazon. Control strategies are proposed to decrease asymptomatic infection prevalence and to block transmission from asymptomatic individuals to the malaria susceptible population. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."

The authors pay attention to specific problems of migration in the Arctic regions of Eurasia. It is proposed to use a combination of analytical and simulation modeling to enhance the quality of prognoses for migration flows. Two parts of the ongoing research are described: technology of entropy-robust identification of the parameters of simulation models and a set of simulation models. The technology of entropy-robust assessment is based on the idea of re-use of formalized knowledge in the analysis of statistical characteristics of the parameters of simulation models. The technology allows to shorten the time and reduce the complexity of development of appropriate simulation models of migration. The complex of simulation models is developed on the basis of a combination of system dynamics, discrete-event and agent-based modeling. The integration of agent-based and analytical modeling to create simulation models of migration processes allows, on the one hand, to ensure the accuracy of the simulation according to the quality of the source data, and on the other, to analyze socioeconomic systems at the required level of abstraction.

Songbirds have previously been described as agents of tick dispersal, and a combination of empirical data and modeling efforts have implicated songbirds in the range expansion of I. scapularis northward into Canada during spring bird migration. The role of fall bird migration has received comparatively less attention, particularly at a continental scale. The aim of the current research was to use a novel individual-based modeling approach (IBM) to investigate the role of southward migrating songbirds in the dispersal of I. scapularis within the continental United States. The IBM used in this research explicitly models dispersal by two extensively studied migrating songbird species, wood thrush Hylocichla mustelina and ovenbird Seiurus aurocapillus. Our IBM predicts the annual dispersal of more than four million ticks by H. mustelina and S. aurocapillus, notably into areas as far west as the Dakotas, and as far south as Central Alabama. Predicted dispersal locations include areas where the southern phenotype of I. scapularis dominates, suggestive of a possible mechanism for previously described unidirectional gene flow from north to south. In addition, the model demonstrates that three species-specific songbird traits – breeding range, migration timing, and propensity for tick attachment – each play a major role in the relative magnitude of tick dispersal by different songbird species. The pattern of I. scapularis dispersal predicted by this model suggests that migrating songbirds may have contributed to the range expansion of the tick historically, and may continue to do so presently and into the future, particularly as climate changes the geographic areas that are suitable for I. scapularis. Ultimately, widespread tick dispersal by migrating songbirds likely increases the human risk of Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases in the United States. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH"

This intrinsically leads to complex stochastic behavior, particularly when several cells are integrated with one microscale object. In this work, we describe the stochastic dynamics of a distributed network of BacteriaBots, microparticles decorated with engineered E. coli bacteria with the capacity for directed migration (chemotaxis) and chemical cell-cell communication (quorum sensing, QS). We developed a statistical model of BacteriaBot motility and chemotaxis which was integrated with an agent-based computational platform to accurately capture their spatiotemporal migration and QS functionality. We show that BacteriaBots have the capacity to significantly outperform analogous networks of free-swimming bacteria in QS-based task completion due to the locally high concentrations of bacteria in each microrobot. Our results demonstrate the utility of BacteriaBots as a programmable multi-agent system, and our model serves to underpin the rational design of such bio-hybrid systems toward specific applications. © 2019 IEEE."

To assess in vitro behavior, MSCs are isolated from rat bone marrow and seeded undifferentiated and differentiated in multiple scaffolds of a gelled biomaterial. Subsequently, cell behavior is evaluated by trypan blue and fluorescence microscopy, which showed that the cells presented high viability and low cell migration in the biomaterial. An agent-based model intended to reproduce as closely as possible the behavior of individual MSCs by simulating cellular-level processes was developed, where the in vitro results are used to identify parameters in the agent-based model that is developed, and which simulates cellular-level processes: Apoptosis, differentiation, proliferation, and migration. Thanks to the results obtained, suggestions for good results in the design and fabrication of the proposed scaffolds and how an agent-based model can be helpful for testing hypothesis are presented in the discussion. It is concluded that assessment of cell behavior through the observation of viability, proliferation, migration, inflammation reduction, and spatial composition in vitro and in silico, represents an appropriate strategy for scaffold engineering. © 2019 by the authors.

Over the past century, numerous processes have been identified as critically contributing to morphogenetic events, but the interplay between the various components and aspects of pattern formation have been much harder to grasp. The combination of traditional biology with mathematical and computational methods has had a profound effect on our current understanding of morphogenesis and led to significant insights and advancements in the field. In particular, the theoretical concepts of reaction-diffusion systems and positional information, proposed by Alan Turing and Lewis Wolpert, respectively, dramatically influenced our general view of morphogenesis, although typically in isolation from one another. In recent years, agent-based modeling has been emerging as a consolidation and implementation of the two theories within a single framework. Agent-based models (ABMs) are unique in their ability to integrate combinations of heterogeneous processes and investigate their respective dynamics, especially in the context of spatial phenomena. In this review, we highlight the benefits and technical challenges associated with ABMs as tools for examining morphogenetic events. These models display unparalleled flexibility for studying various morphogenetic phenomena at multiple levels and have the important advantage of informing future experimental work, including the targeted engineering of tissues and organs. © 2019 Glen et al."

To understand how such agent-based complex systems function and respond to change and disturbances, agent-based modeling (ABM) is increasingly recognized as the main way forward. Many motivating examples of agent-based models exist that are realistic enough to successfully support the management of complex systems, but these solutions are case-specific and contribute few general insights into the functioning of systems. General theory, though, is highly needed because we cannot model each system and question. Still, across disciplines, a critical mass of expertise has accumulated that could transform ABM into a more coherent and efficient approach to discover the functioning of complex social-economic-ecological systems.

The coordination between leader cell and follower cell impact the speed of collective cell migration. However, there are still very few papers to study the effect of the stimulus signal released by the leader on the follower. Using 3D time-lapse microscopy image to keep track of the process of cell movement provides an unprecedented opportunity to systematically investigate and analysis collective cell migration. Traditional approach to study the process always based on reality scene, but are too time-consuming as the number of cells grows exponentially. Agent-based modeling is a robust framework that approximates cells as isotropic, elastic, and adhesive objects. In this paper, we use the agent-based modeling framework to build a simulation platform for cell movement. Its goal is to construct a biomimetic environment to prove the importance of stimulus signals between leader cell and follower cell. We use the recent popular deep reinforcement learning to train cells and to control the quantity of signal.

A special focus is given to rural areas, and the possible effects of different climate change scenarios on internal migration patterns. To achieve this, I prepared an agent-based modelling tool, which implements four different migration types with distinct flows and characteristic participant groups (student migration, labour migration, suburbanisation, amenity migration). In overall, 33 scenarios were elaborated, which may differ from each other in their fertility and mortality assumptions, their climatic predictions, and their anticipated socioeconomic paradigm. According to the low natural movement scenarios, the Hungarian population may shrink to 8,342 thousand inhabitants by 2051, while the high natural movement scenarios anticipate 9,138 thousand inhabitants. A drastic shift in the age structure can also be expected: the old-age-dependency ratio will increase from 25% (2011) to 61-65%. The territorial differences in ageing will also deepen, which will pose serious social sustainability challenges. From the three delimited spatial categories (urban areas, commutable rural areas, remote rural areas), the forecasts show the greatest variance in case of the remote rural areas. This is caused by the considerable shift in the migration patterns between the Business as usual and Paradigm shift socioeconomic scenarios. In contrast to this, the implementation of the different climatic scenarios did not bring significant changes.

The first post-war housing estates are inevitably approaching the end of their intended life span and, unfortunately, thus far a method to extensively test and monitor these housing estates has not yet been established. Currently, attention is focused purely on analysing the technical condition of the buildings, while the most important issue, that is, their present and future residents, is ignored. Collecting the necessary data on large residential estates is the first, extremely important step towards understanding the processes taking place in European cities. Thanks to agent-based modelling, which utilises both the decision-making and the uniqueness of individuals and households, a detailed analysis of bottom-up processes that occur naturally in the local community is possible. Using one of the Polish housing estates, Popowice in Wrocław, as an example, available statistical data was systematised and simulations were carried out to predict the natural, spontaneous development of the estate. The simulations reflect the dynamics of the bottom-up processes within the local population that have a direct impact on the scale of migration, as well as the socio-demographic polarization of the local community. Intentionally, the top-down approach has not been implemented in order to allow identification and analysis of self-modifying changes. In this simulation, trends are sought only based on the autonomy of individual people. The need to make a precise diagnosis and establish guidelines for revitalization plays a key role in the management of urban space. Strengthening the desirable, and limiting the negative processes can play a crucial role in the guideline-setting process, ultimately enabling an optimal model for the revitalization of large housing estates to be created. © 2019 WIT Press."

Our model considers the potential of people to migrate as well as those who do migrate. Thus, the model introduces a pre-selection stage into the act of migrating. This is mainly performed using a hypothesis, which was previously discussed in other theoretical works covering the dynamics of migration, but rarely tested. To migrate, an individual must have a certain profile and a real pecuniary gain primarily sought through highly probable hiring strategies. We use an agent-based model to simulate individuals’ migration. Two types of agents are considered: Individuals and Regions. We describe each type of agents by a set of equations. We also consider many variables to introduce Individuals’ and Regions’ properties and heterogeneity. The use of agent-based model allows for the consideration of a high heterogeneity of agents while at the same time permitting us to test the effect of individuals ‘self-selection’.

This is particularly true for cell migration which requires the co-ordinated activity of hundreds of individual components within cells. Mathematical modelling can help understand these complex systems by breaking the system into discrete steps which can then be interrogated in silico. In this review, we highlight scenarios in cell migration where mathematical modelling can be applied and discuss what types of modelling are most suited. Almost any aspect of cell migration is amenable to mathematical modelling from the modelling of intracellular processes such as chemokine receptor signalling and actin filament branching to larger scale processes such as the movement of individual cells or populations of cells through their environment. Two common ways of approaching this modelling are the use of models based on differential equations or agent-based modelling. The application of both these approaches to cell migration are discussed with specific examples along with common software tools to facilitate the process for non-mathematicians. We also highlight the challenges of modelling cell migration and the need for rigorous experimental work to effectively parameterise a model. © 2019 The Author(s)."

Accordingly, this paper proposes a novel methodology for generating a global agent-based model involving detailed migratory patterns of waterfowl. The methodology transforms geographic information systems (GIS) data to generate metapopulation for agents that model collocated flocks of birds. Generic migratory corridors are suitably adapted to model migratory flyways for each waterfowl metapopulation. The resulting data is generated in XML format compatible with our simulation-based epidemiological analysis environment called SEARUMS. Case studies conducted using SEARUMS and the generated models for high-risk waterfowl species indicate good correlation between simulated and observed viral dispersion patterns, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

Agent-based fish (AB-fish) are always located on a node of the CFD mesh and move by selecting the neighboring node that minimizes fatigue. A possible limitation of this approach is that the AB-fish movement exhibits a dependence upon the CFD mesh. The proposed modified approach allows the AB-fish to occupy any point in the computational domain and to continually (within the size of the time step) update their minimum fatigue path.

Further, mobility provision for young and elderly people through a system consisting of shared, on-demand autonomous vehicles (AVs) is proposed and evaluated. We use a generalized optimization approach including investment, driving, and social costs to determine the optimal number of vehicles. Future demographics of the population are simulated through a cohort analysis where migration based on historical data is taken into account. The method is applied to the case of Izu Oshima, a Japanese island strongly affected by demographic change and comprising of a high number of immobile citizens. The promotion of settlement in vacant houses in different areas of Izu Oshima through urban land use policies is simulated and compared with respect to urban sprawl, spatial mobility demand, and the cost of mobility provision.

From the software productivity viewpoint, model designers would prefer general ABM frameworks for GPU parallelization. However, having transited from single-node or cluster-computing platforms to GPUs, most general ABM frameworks maintain their APIs at the script level, delegate only a limited number of agent functions to GPUs, and copy agent data between host and device memory for each function call, which cannot ease agent description nor maximize GPU parallelism. To respond to these problems, we have developed the MASS (Multi-Agent Spatial Simulation) CUDA library that allows users to describe all simulation models in CUDA C++, to automate entire model parallelization at GPU, and to minimize host-to-device memory transfer. However, our straightforward implementation did not improve the parallel performance. Focusing on the data-parallel computation with GPU, we examined MASS overheads in GPU memory usage and developed optimization techniques that reduce kernel context switches, optimize kernel configuration, use constant memory, and reduce overheads incurred by agent population, migration, and termination. These techniques improved Heat2D and SugarScape’s execution performance, respectively 3.9 times and 5.8 times faster than the corresponding C++ sequential programs.

Models of appropriate complexity facilitate comprehension and improve understanding of the variables driving system processes. In the context of conservation planning decision-making or research efforts, a useful model can aid interpretation and avoid overfitting by including only essential elements. Models can serve two related, but different purposes: understanding and prediction of future system behavior. Predictive models can require several iterations of refinement and empirical data gathering to be useful for conservation planning. Models with less predictive ability can be used to enhance understanding of system function and generate hypotheses for empirical evaluation. Modeling monarch butterfly systems, whether it be landscape-scale movement in breeding habitats, migratory behavior, or population dynamics at monthly or yearly timeframes, is challenging because the systems encompass complex spatial and temporal interactions across nested scales that are difficult, if not impossible, to empirically observe or comprehend without simplification. We review mathematical, statistical, and simulation models that have provided insights into monarch butterfly systems. Mathematical models have provided understanding of underlying processes that may be driving monarch systems. Statistical models have provided understanding of patterns in empirical data, which may represent underlying mechanisms. Simulations models have provided understanding of mechanisms driving systems and provide the potential to link mechanisms with data to build more predictive models. As an example, recently published agent-based models of non-migratory eastern North American monarch butterfly movement and egg-laying may provide the means to explore how different spatial patterns of habitat, habitat quality, and the interaction of stressors can influence future adult recruitment. The migratory process, however, has not been addressed with agent-based modeling. Using western monarch migration as an example, we describe how modeling could be used to provide insights into migratory dynamics. Future integration of migratory models with non-migratory and population dynamics models may provide better understanding and ultimately prediction of monarch butterfly movement and population dynamics at a continental scale. © 2019 Grant and Bradbury."

VEGF-A is the main pro-angiogenic chemoattractant and it can bind to the decoy receptor VEGFR1 or to VEGFR2 to induce sprouting. Active sprout cells express Dll4, which binds to Notch1 on neighboring cells, in turn inhibiting VEGFR2 expression. It is known that the balance between VEGFR2 and VEGFR1 determines tip selection and network architecture, however the quantitative interrelationship of the receptors and their interrelated balances, also with relation to Dll4-Notch1 signaling, remains yet largely unknown. Here, we present an agent-based computer model of sprouting angiogenesis, integrating VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 in a detailed model of cellular signaling. Our model reproduces experimental data on VEGFR1 knockout. We show that soluble VEGFR1 improves the efficiency of angiogenesis by directing sprouts away from existing cells over a wide range of parameters. Our analysis unravels the relevance of the stability of the active notch intracellular domain as a dominating hub in this regulatory network. Our analysis quantitatively dissects the regulatory interactions in sprouting angiogenesis.

Much of it will have to migrate towards the poles at a rate far beyond normal speeds. In this context, the concept of assisted migration has been proposed to facilitate the migration of trees. Yet current practices of assisted migration focus on “where tree species should be in the future” and thus have many uncertainties. We suggest that more attention should be paid on the flow of forest migration. Therefore, this study develops a three-step methodology for mapping the flow of forest migration under climate change. Since the migration of trees depends on the activities of their seed dispersal agents, the accessibility of landscapes for dispersal agents is mainly considered in this study. The developed method combines a least-cost path model, a graph-based approach, and a circuit theory-based model. The least-cost path model is applied to map the movement of dispersal agents, based on which graph-based indices are used to evaluate the accessibility of landscapes for dispersal agents, which in turn is used as the basis for circuit theory-based modelling to map the flow of forest migration. The proposed method is demonstrated by a case study in the Greater Manchester area, UK. The resulting maps identify areas with high probability of climate-driven migration of trees. © 2019 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal)."

In the last decade, a number of centralized control strategies based on native biological mechanisms have been demonstrated; however, decentralized cooperative control of a swarm of bio-hybrid microrobots has rarely been explored. In this work, we use our previously developed agent-based computational model to explore the utility of integrating synthetic biology with bio-hybrid microrobotics with the goal of developing strategies for robust decentralized control of bio-hybrid microrobotic systems. To this end, our Nanoscale Bacteria-Enabled Autonomous Delivery System (NanoBEADS), wherein each agent is comprised of an Escherichia coli bacterium conjugated with an ensemble of nanoparticles, was used as a model system. We imparted bacteria with engineered biological circuits to facilitate agent-agent communication and enable predictable and robust cooperative control of a network of NanoBEADS agents. We developed a hybrid control strategy wherein a centralized chemotaxis-based control scheme is used to direct migration, and a decentralized quorum sensing (QS)-based control scheme enables the agents to independently coordinate a cooperative behavior (fluorescent protein expression). We then computationally analyzed the role of bacterial subsystem properties and spatiotemporal changes in population organization in the emergent behavior (i.e., the activation time of the QS response) of the NanoBEADS. We show that the spatial changes in NanoBEADS agents’ distribution, in response to the centralized control input, and the mass transport boundary conditions are critical factors in determining the dynamics as well as the sensitivity and robustness of the QS response. We analyze the stark differences in feasible QS parameter domains under dissimilar chemoattractant gradients and show that the flow boundary conditions may greatly influence system function. Altogether, we show that a bacteria-based bio-hybrid system must be designed with careful consideration of growth rate, chemotaxis properties, QS properties, and the environment initial and boundary conditions in the context of its target application.

Samples from resident groups (citizens and non-citizens) participated in targeted surveys and useful answers were extracted in relation to the migration likelihood, push and pull factors that May affect their decisions, spatial preferences for new cities and their opinions on segregation by nationality. Specifically, the survey results showed significant interest of residents in moving to the new cities. For citizens, the most important factors in deciding whether to move or not were proximity to their close family and housing availability, while for non-citizens the most important factor was the creation of new employment opportunities. Both survey groups agreed that existing city property prices are too high and make the prospect of moving to a new city more attractive. The responses were transferred in an Agent Based Model, and the simulations showed certain differences to the official projections for 2050 without the public responses, in regards to the geographical distribution of the most desirable suburbs. Furthermore, the simulations showed that in the new cities, nationality segregation levels are expected to drop by at Least 15% compared to the 2015 levels. The findings May be utilised by the authorities to modify the master plan accordingly. © 2018 Alghais et al.

The first-order emergence, also referred to as swarm intelligence, is well studied, while higher order levels of emergent behaviour have not received much attention yet. Second-order emergent behaviour arises from the interactions of individuals, which are themselves the result of first-order emergent behaviour. Dictyostelium discoideum provides a compelling case for studying both first- and second-order emergence. Individual cells move around on their own when there is plenty of food. When food is scarce, cells self-aggregate towards a leading center cell (first-order emergent behaviour) to build a super-organism, similar to a slug. The slug displays properties that none of the cells has on its own (e.g. sensitivity to light and heat). It moves as a whole (second-order emergent behaviour) looking for a suitable place to transform into a fruiting body (also known as sporocarp), where later the cells resume their individual behaviour. This paper focuses specifically on the aggregation and migration phases of Dictyostelium discoideum. We present two agent-based models, implemented in Matlab for first order and Python for second order. They display a series of emergent properties, among others homogeneous aggregation territories size (first order) and merging of slugs or new property as sensitivity to light (second order). Future works involve implementing and experimenting both first- and second-order emergence in swarm robotics, and identification of design patterns for engineering higher order emergent behaviour in artificial systems. © 2018, ISAROB."

Models are particularly useful when dealing with complex dynamic systems (as pelagic ecosystems) where data are limited and if various ‘what if’ scenarios should be tested. The aim of this study was to produce and implement an integrated modelling approach, linking high resolution hydrodynamic models (HDM) of the marine environment with correlative species distribution models (SDM) and agent-based models (ABM), for describing the spatio-temporal distribution and movements of Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) in the Norwegian Sea. The SDM was fitted with scientific mackerel trawl data as response variables (collected in July and August 2006–2014) and temperature (from the HDM), water depth and time period as predictors of spatial distributions. The SDM was able to produce dynamic predictions of a similar order of magnitude as observed catch per unit effort (CPUE) as well as realistic large-scale distribution patterns, when tested on independent data (not included in the modelling). The ABM was calibrated, with normalized SDM predictions (habitat suitability as a proxy for food availability) and hydrodynamics as input and simulated on a single year (2013) for the period May–October, when the migratory mackerel is present in the study area. A pattern-oriented modelling (POM) approach was used to verify if the model reproduced multiple observed real-world patterns. The ABM produced similar patterns as observed regarding migration timing, growth and large scale geographic distribution. Fine scaled information on mackerel movement and behaviour is limited, which is also reflected in the results. More data and knowledge are therefore required to improve the patterns emerging from fine scaled processes. The potential of the model for assessing an impact of a single seismic survey (mimicking a real survey) was finally evaluated. The exercise allowed estimating the number of affected fish (within 50 km from the sound source) and potential changes in local migrations, with the specific assumed minimum sound pressure thresholds (resulting in a fleeing reaction by the mackerel) set to 165 dB re 1 μPa. The model framework was shown to be useful by allowing simulations of impact scenarios in a realistic and dynamic environment. The model can be further updated when data on fine scale movements of mackerel and most importantly when improved data on response behaviour to impacts of sound become available. © 2018 Elsevier B.V."

In this paper, evolutionary search algorithms were applied on an agent based model that captures the house hunting strategy of the honeybees. Four search algorithms were applied (random search, mutation hill climber, genetic algorithm and simulated annealing) to find the range of parameters that lead to fast emigration of the colony. We find that a low value in the quorum and initial percentage of the scouts with high initial exploration time favors the minimization of the emigration time of the colony.

In this study, I use an agent-based model to elucidate how numerous individual-level components contribute to the collective decision process during house-hunting in a mass-recruiting ant species. Myrmecina nipponica combines the use of pheromone trails with a quorum decision rule in collective decisions among nest sites when searching for a new home. The model employed only individual-level rules but accurately emulated group-level properties observed in empirical studies. Simulations suggest that in this system i) both social and private information are necessary for effective decision making, ii) decision making was effective even with very low numbers of ‘discriminating’ individuals, iii) individual acceptance thresholds were more influential than quorum thresholds in tuning decisions to emphasise speed or accuracy, and iv) acceptance thresholds could also help tune decisions to suit environmental complexity. Similar findings in species using one-to-one recruitment suggest that some individual parameters, such as acceptance thresholds, may hold key functions in collective decision making regardless of the form of recruitment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

T cell activation occurs when dendritic cells, which have already interacted with the pathogen, scan a T cell that is cognate for (responsive to) the pathogen. This often occurs inside lymph nodes. The time it takes for this scanning event to occur, indeed the probability that it will occur at all, depends on many factors, including the rate that T cells and dendritic cells enter and leave the lymph node as well as the geometry of the lymph node and of course other cellular and molecular parameters. In this paper, we develop a hybrid stochastic-deterministic mathematical model at the tissue scale of the lymph node and simulate dendritic cells and cognate T cells to investigate the most important physiological factors leading to a successful and timely immune response after a vaccination. We use an agent-based model to describe the small population of cognate naive T cells and a partial differential equation description for the concentration of mature dendritic cells. We estimate the model parameters based on the known literature and measurements previously taken in our lab. We perform a parameter sensitivity analysis to quantify the sensitivity of the model results to the parameters. The results show that increasing T cell inflow through high endothelial venules, restricting cellular egress via the efferent lymph and increasing the total dendritic cell count by improving vaccinations are the among the most important physiological factors leading to an improved immune response. We also find that increasing the physical size of lymph nodes improves the overall likelihood that an immune response will take place but has a fairly weak effect on the response rate. The nature of dendritic cell trafficking through the LN (either passive or active transport) seems to have little effect on the overall immune response except if a change in overall egress time is observed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

Besides forming a geographical barrier, mountains have a profound impact on the resulting wind flow. We use a novel framework of mathematical models to investigate the influences of wind and topography on nocturnal passerine bird behaviour, and to assess the energy costs for different flight strategies for crossing the Jura Mountains. The mathematical models include three biological models of bird behaviour: i) wind drift compensation; ii) adaptation of flight height for favourable winds; and, iii) avoidance of obstacles (cross over and/or circumvention of an obstacle following a minimum energy expenditure strategy), which are assessed separately and in combination. Further, we use a mesoscale weather model for high-resolution predictions of the wind fields. We simulate the broad front nocturnal passerine migration for autumn nights with peak migration intensities. The bird densities retrieved from a weather radar are used as the initial intensities and to specify the vertical distributions of the simulated birds. It is shown that migration over complex terrain represents the most expensive flight option in terms of energy expenditure, and wind is seen to be the main factor that influences the energy expenditure in the bird's preferred flight direction. Further, the combined effects of wind and orography lead to a high concentration of migratory birds within the favourable wind conditions of the Swiss lowlands and north of the Jura Mountains. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

Previous efforts have demonstrated that agent-based, multi-scale modeling systems can integrate physical and biological rules and provide new avenues to study developmental systems. However, the application of these systems to model cell movement is still challenging and requires a comprehensive understanding of regulatory networks at the right scales. Recent developments in deep learning and reinforcement learning provide an unprecedented opportunity to explore cell movement using 3D time-lapse microscopy images. Results: We present a deep reinforcement learning approach within an agent-based modeling system to characterize cell movement in the embryonic development of C.elegans. Our modeling system captures the complexity of cell movement patterns in the embryo and overcomes the local optimization problem encountered by traditional rule-based, agent-based modeling that uses greedy algorithms. We tested our model with two real developmental processes: the anterior movement of the Cpaaa cell via intercalation and the rearrangement of the superficial left-right asymmetry. In the first case, the model results suggested that Cpaaa’s intercalation is an active directional cell movement caused by the continuous effects from a longer distance (farther than the length of two adjacent cells), as opposed to a passive movement caused by neighbor cell movements. In the second case, a leader-follower mechanism well explained the collective cell movement pattern in the asymmetry rearrangement. These results showed that our approach to introduce deep reinforcement learning into agent-based modeling can test regulatory mechanisms by exploring cell migration paths in a reverse engineering perspective. This model opens new doors to explore the large datasets generated by live imaging. © The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved."

This expectation is difficult to test empirically for three reasons. First, unauthorized migration is clandestine and often unobservable. Second, interpersonal ties between migrants and would-be migrants form a self-perpetuating system, which adapts in ways that are difficult to observe or predict. Third, empirical evaluations of immigration policy are vulnerable to endogeneity and other issues of causal inference. In this paper, we pair tailor-made empirical designs with an agent-based computational model (ABM) to capture the dynamics of a migration system that often elude empirical analysis, while grounding agent rules and characteristics with primary data collected in Jamaica, an origin country. We find that some government-imposed restrictions on migrants can deter total migration, but others are ineffective. Relative to a system of free movement, the minimal eligibility conditions required to classify migrants into visa categories alone make migration inaccessible for many. Restrictive policies imposed on student and high-skilled visa categories have little added effect because eligible individuals are likely able to migrate through alternative legal categories. Meanwhile, restrictions on family-based visas result in significant reductions in total migration. However, they also produce the largest reorientation toward unauthorized channels—an unintended consequence that even the highest rates of apprehension do not effectively. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

In this approach, cells are represented as particles located at their geometrical center, but also as a polygonal body derived from the Voronoi diagram. Furthermore, we model the tissue as a continuum medium with different spatial domains that represent cell and substrate materials. In fact, the mechanical behavior of each domain is affected by the presence of cells from the discrete model. Moreover, we solve this mechanical problem using the finite element method (FEM). The forces generated by cells are projected to the FE mesh, that is created dynamically during the simulation from the discrete cell representation. After the FE resolution, we use the mesh displacements to determine the new cell positions in the agent-based model. Finally, to demonstrate the potential of this approach to model epithelial tissue mechanics, we simulate two well-studied cases of collective cell migration: durotaxis and gap closure. We use the experimental data from the literature to validate our numerical results. Therefore, the modeling strategy here presented offers a new perspective for a deeper understanding of tissue mechanics that emerge from cell dynamics in epithelial layers. © 2018 Elsevier B.V."

However, coexistence between phases of different types of order has not been reported. We demonstrate the emergence of dynamic coexistence of ordered states with fluctuating nematic and polar symmetry in an actomyosin motility assay. Combining experiments with agent-based simulations, we identify sufficiently weak interactions that lack a clear alignment symmetry as a prerequisite for coexistence. Thus, the symmetry of macroscopic order becomes an emergent and dynamic property of the active system.

Still, in such areas, where traditional data-driven, statistical approaches prevail, the hypothesis-driven design of agent-based models leads to questioning the validity of these models. Consequently, suitable means to increase the confidence into models and simulation results are required. To that end, explicit, replicable simulation experiments play a central role in model design and validation. However, the analysis of more complex models implies executing various experiments, each of which combines various methods. To streamline these experimentation processes a flexible computational simulation environment is necessary. With a new binding between SESSL – an internal domain-specific language for simulation experiments – and ML3 – a simulator for linked lives designed specifically for agent-based demographic models – we cater for these objectives and provide a powerful simulation tool. The proposed approach can serve as a foundation for current efforts of employing advanced and statistical model analysis of agent-based demographic models, as part of a wider process of iterative model building.

Agent-based models (ABMs) are valuable tools to study these linkages because they can represent individual migration decisions of human actors. Indeed, there is an increasing, yet small, number of ABMs that consider the natural environment in rural migration processes. Therefore, we reviewed 15 ABMs of environment-migration linkages in rural contexts to synthesize the current state of the art. The reviewed ABMs are mostly applied in tropical contexts, serve a wide range of purposes, and cover diverse scales and types of environmental factors, migration processes, and social-ecological feedbacks. We identified potential for future model development with respect to the (1) complexity of environmental influence factors, (2) representation of relevant migration flows, and (3) type of social-ecological couplings. We found that existing models tend to not include fully integrated feedbacks and provide recommendations for the further development of ABMs to contribute to an understanding of the environment-migration-nexus in the future. © 2018 by the author(s)."

It proposes that service delivery network design would benefit from complex adaptive systems (CAS) modeling approaches to recreate organizational phenomena driven by the interaction of the organization with its operating environment. This approach, paired with experimental design methods can serve as a virtual laboratory. We take the case of social service delivery (SSD) organizations that are structured as nonprofit organizations providing humanitarian assistance and relief services. These organizations often serve different geographical regions, thus, racial composition, migration patterns, and wealth of the populations served are factors that vary between locations. SSDs operate through service nodes (i.e., field offices, chapters, branches) in a network configuration. Therefore, the managerial decision of where to locate the field offices is an important one. An agent-based model to recreate agents’ interactions as proxies of those exchanges occurring in real SSD settings is used. A series of validation experiments instill confidence that our model can be used as a virtual research laboratory. This paper contributes to the field of organizational design by testing a model able to recreate different policies that combined with different operating conditions impact the network over time and space. In addition, it provides experimental insights on what type of network configuration might provide a higher number of services delivered over time across the service network. The results can inform those defining the service system architecture looking to achieve SSD's goals considering the demographics of the markets served. © 2018"

The iTLE assumes that individuals and households are the agents, and parcels are the objects. It is conceptualized following the life-course perspectives and theories to address the evolution of multi-domain decision interactions over the life-course of the agents. Residential location is simulated as a two-stage process of residential mobility, and location choice. Life-stage simulation includes aging, death, birth, out-migration, in-migration, and household formation. The iTLE is implemented at a yearly time-step from 2006 to 2021 for Halifax, Canada. A 100% synthetic population is generated for the base year 2006, which shows a SRMSE value of 0.37 and APE measures of less than 5% for 89% of the DAs. The simulation results are validated with the 2011 Census information. The validation results suggest that the iTLE generates reasonably satisfactory population estimates. For example, around 52% of the DAs show an APE value of less than 30%, and 37% of the DAs show a difference in the number of households of less than ±50. The predicted results regarding the spatio-temporal evolution of Halifax suggests an increase of around 14% population in 2021 compared to 2007. Younger population residing closer to the CBD are predicted to be more frequent movers than older population residing farther away from the CBD. Higher proportions of the households are predicted in the locations within 25 km from the CBD over the years. Proportion of households in these high density neighborhoods are predicted to increase from 68% in 2007 to 71% in 2021. In 2021, a higher density of single person households are predicted in the urban core. Density is predicted to be more variable and skewed towards suburban neighborhoods as household composition changes through marriage and child birth. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

An appealing characteristic of aeroecology is that we can observe both these aggregate behaviors of large groups (using tools such as radar and observational networks) as well as the behavior of individual animals (by employing animal tracking technology). Traditional population modeling efforts focus on equations that mimic natural populations in terms of overall population size and/or mean population parameters, often discounting mechanisms operating on the individual level that give rise to overall population dynamics. Concurrent advancements in computing capacity and animal tracking methodologies provide us with the opportunity to examine how the actions of individuals scale up to give rise to population-level phenomena in the aerosphere. More specifically, we can now model populations as a collection of individuals that behave independently, and we can validate the inferences from these agent-based models by tracking actual animals over the course of their annual cycle. In this chapter, we provide an example of how an agent-based model can be used to predict migration behavior across a species range based on a small set of actual migration tracks. The example provides a generalizable framework for using agent-based models as a link between data from individuals and broad-scale phenomena. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2017."

Spontaneous migration, without apparent goal, is also considered.

Properly selecting and applying such metrics requires substantial background in mathematics and understanding the relevant management arena. To address this multidimensional challenge, we demonstrate and compare three measurements of habitat quality: graph-, occupancy-, and demographic-based metrics. Each metric provides insights into system dynamics, at the expense of increasing amounts and complexity of data and models. Our descriptions and comparisons of diverse habitat-quality metrics provide means for practitioners to overcome the modeling challenges associated with management or conservation of such highly mobile species. Whereas previous guidance for applying habitat-quality metrics has been scattered in diversified tracks of literature, we have brought this information together into an approachable format including accessible descriptions and a modeling case study for a typical example that conservation professionals can adapt for their own decision contexts and focal populations. Considerations for Resource Managers: Management objectives, proposed actions, data availability and quality, and model assumptions are all relevant considerations when applying and interpreting habitat-quality metrics. Graph-based metrics answer questions related to habitat centrality and connectivity, are suitable for populations with any movement pattern, quantify basic spatial and temporal patterns of occupancy and movement, and require the least data. Occupancy-based metrics answer questions about likelihood of persistence or colonization, are suitable for populations that undergo localized extinctions, quantify spatial and temporal patterns of occupancy and movement, and require a moderate amount of data. Demographic-based metrics answer questions about relative or absolute population size, are suitable for populations with any movement pattern, quantify demographic processes and population dynamics, and require the most data. More real-world examples applying occupancy-based, agent-based, and continuous-based metrics to seasonally migratory species are needed to better understand challenges and opportunities for applying these metrics more broadly.

The lifetime of individual cities includes periods of fast growth, slow growth and periods of shrinkage. There exists an extensive literature concerned with possible means to manage specific pathologies. It is our view that the design of specific policies should be the result of a comprehensive model of urban health. While not all cities go through the entire life cycle, a comprehensive theory of cities and specific policies need to include specification of the interaction of the various forces that shape the entire range of urban patterns and identification of specific combinations of values that create phase transitions among these patterns. To sort these ideas we suggest that there is a need to consider and incorporate the structure and timing of innovation activities, agglomeration effects that they generate, interurban migration patterns and assorted feedback mechanisms. We hypothesize that these flows depend on the activity rhythms of the various processes and their differential impact on cities. We present a biology inspired rudimentary framework as a basis for the construction of an ABM of cities with a focus on the nature of time and as a basis for analyzing urban dynamics.1 © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"

The agents from census micro data are located in their rural origin with an empirical-estimated prior propensity to move. The population-scale social network is a hybrid one, combining observed family ties and locations of the origin with a parameter space calibrated from census, survey and aggregate data and sampled using a stepwise Latin Hypercube Sampling method. At monthly intervals, some agents migrate and these migratory acts change the social network by turning within-nonmigrant connections to between-migrant-nonmigrant connections, turning local connections to nonlocal connections, and adding among-migrant connections. In turn, the changing social network structure updates migratory propensities of those well-connected nonmigrants who become more likely to move. These two processes iterate over time. Using a core–periphery method developed from the k-core decomposition method, we identify and quantify the network structural changes and map these changes with the migration acceleration patterns. We conclude that network structural changes are essential for explaining migration acceleration observed in China during the 1995–2000 period. © 2017"

The lack of targeted distribution of workers in a market economy requires the study of systemic processes in the labor market that lead to different dynamics of the number of employed in the sectors of the economy. In this case, personal strategies for choosing labor activity by economic agents become important. The presence of different strategies leads to the emergence of strata in the labor market with a dynamically changing number of employees, unevenly distributed among the sectors of the economy. As a result, non-linear fluctuations in the number of employed population can be observed, the toolkit of agent-based modeling is relevant for the study of the fluctuations. In the article, we examined in-phase and anti-phase fluctuations in the number of employees by economic activity on the example of the Jewish Autonomous Region in Russia. The fluctuations found in the time series of statistical data for 2008–2016. We show that such fluctuations appear by age groups of workers. In view of this, we put forward a hypothesis that the agent in the labor market chooses a place of work by a strategy, related with his age group. It directly affects the distribution of the number of employed for different cohorts and the total number of employed in the sectors of the economy. The agent determines the strategy taking into account the socio-economic characteristics of the branches of the economy (different levels of wages, working conditions, prestige of the profession). We construct a basic agent-oriented model of a three-branch economy to test the hypothesis. The model takes into account various strategies of economic agents, including the choice of the highest wages, the highest prestige of the profession and the best working conditions by the agent. As a result of numerical experiments, we show that the availability of various industry selection strategies and the age preferences of employers within the industry lead to periodic and complex dynamics of the number of different-aged employees. Age preferences may be a consequence, for example, the requirements of employer for the existence of work experience and education. Also, significant changes in the age structure of the employed population may result from migration. © 2018 Mihail Yu. Khavinson, Alexey N. Kolobov."

It causes the changes in migration flows and influences the socio-economic development of territories involved in the project. Preliminary assessment of the consequences of the implementation of similar projects requires the use of models. One of the modern directions of simulating is the agent-based approach. It allows to recreate a structure and behaviour of real socioeconomic systems in an artificial environment and to imitate their behaviour if external conditions change. The realism of the simulation of the main socio-economic processes determines the success of pursuing agent-based models to meet the challenges of forecasting. The article describes the construction of the agent-based model of the countries of Eurasia, imitating the basic processes of population movement in these countries, as well as the consequences of implementing large infrastructure projects as a result of the actions of many independent agents. There are two types of agents in the model: a) countries that are capable of lobbying for the implementation of profitable projects, and b) people who live in these countries, who create families, give birth to children and choose the type of activity and place of residence. In agents behaviour’s algorithm, we consider factors, revealed as a result of the research of actual migration processes in the countries of Eurasia. This has allowed to recreate in the model the imitation of people’s behaviour close to reality. The model construction was tested for two routes of New Silk Road. During the experiments, we monitored the changes of economic and demographic indicators for each participating country. Thus, for Russia the growth of total trade turnover (9.6 %) and net export (1.5 %) was observed. Participation in the project gave to China the growth 3.8 % and 7.7 %, respectively. The small countries (Georgia, Bulgaria) showed the reduction of migration outflow and improvement of age structure of the population. The model can be used for preliminary assessment of the consequences of the large infrastructure projects implementation. © 2018 Institute of Economics Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences."

Migration flow rates across the Mediterranean have dropped in recent years, but fatalities have increased and border pressure is still high. Recent operations by local governments, international agencies, and NGO organizations have saved many lives and improved data collection practices, yet they have not been fully successful in responding to the high volume of travel and unexpected rate spikes in migrant trips. Different Operational Constructs and asset strategies have been studied resulting in relevant organizations investing in Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) for monitoring and detection. However, many questions about the most effective deployment of these assets still remain although. This study is centered on the development of a modeling and simulation environment, as well as a decision support tool for conducting system-of-systems comparisons of UAS swarm and surface fleet asset combinations. The environment is an agent-based simulation built in the In-House tool Janus, which leverages the NASA World-Wind SDK. The simulation tool and dashboard provide a trade-off environment for parametric analysis of swarm capabilities. A case study is performed for operations by the Italian Coast Guard off the coast of Libya. Results confirm the success of implementing UAS and coordinated swarm systems. Further analysis examines the trade-off of mission effectiveness and cost, with consideration of the resilience and robustness of the system-of-systems. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

There are typically two approaches to modeling cell migration: either microscale, discrete or macroscale, continuum. The discrete approach, using agent-based models (ABMs), is typically stochastic and accounts for properties at the cell-scale. Conversely, the continuum approach, in which cell density is often modeled as a system of deterministic partial differential equations (PDEs), provides a global description of the migration at the population level. Deterministic models have the advantage that they are generally more amenable to mathematical analysis. They can lead to significant insights for situations in which the system comprises a large number of cells, at which point simulating a stochastic ABM becomes computationally expensive. However, finding an appropriate continuum model to describe the collective behavior of a system of individual cells can be a difficult task. Deterministic models are often specified on a phenomenological basis, which reduces their predictive power. Stochastic ABMs have advantages over their deterministic continuum counterparts. In particular, ABMs can represent individual-level behaviors (such as cell proliferation and cell–cell interaction) appropriately and are amenable to direct parameterization using experimental data. It is essential, therefore, to establish direct connections between stochastic microscale behaviors and deterministic macroscale dynamics. In this chapter we describe how, in some situations, these two distinct modeling approaches can be unified into a discrete-continuum equivalence framework. We carry out detailed examinations of a range of fundamental models of cell movement in one dimension. We then extend the discussion to more general models, which focus on incorporating other important factors that affect the migration of cells including cell proliferation and cell–cell interactions. We provide an overview of some of the more recent advances in this field and we point out some of the relevant questions that remain unanswered. © 2018 Elsevier B.V."

The Zika virus was first discovered in 1947. It was neglected until a major outbreak occurred on Yap Island, Micronesia, in 2007. Teratogenic effects resulting in microcephaly in newborn infants is the greatest public health threat. In 2016, the Zika virus epidemic was declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Consequently, mathematical models were constructed to explicitly elucidate related transmission dynamics. Survey Methodology. In this review article, two steps of journal article searching were performed. First, we attempted to identify mathematical models previously applied to the study of vector-borne diseases using the search terms ""dynamics,"" ""mathematical model,"" ""modeling,"" and ""vector-borne"" together with the names of vector-borne diseases including chikungunya, dengue, malaria, West Nile, and Zika. Then the identified types of model were further investigated. Second, we narrowed down our survey to focus on only Zika virus research. The terms we searched for were ""compartmental,"" ""spatial,"" ""metapopulation,"" ""network,"" ""individual-based,"" ""agent-based"" AND ""Zika."" All relevant studies were included regardless of the year of publication. We have collected research articles that were published before August 2017 based on our search criteria. In this publication survey, we explored the Google Scholar and PubMed databases. Results. We found five basic model architectures previously applied to vector-borne virus studies, particularly in Zika virus simulations. These include compartmental, spatial, metapopulation, network, and individual-based models. We found that Zika models carried out for early epidemics were mostly fit into compartmental structures and were less complicated compared to the more recent ones. Simple models are still commonly used for the timely assessment of epidemics. Nevertheless, due to the availability of large-scale real-world data and computational power, recently there has been growing interest in more complex modeling frameworks. Discussion. Mathematical models are employed to explore and predict how an infectious disease spreads in the real world, evaluate the disease importation risk, and assess the effectiveness of intervention strategies. As the trends in modeling of infectious diseases have been shifting towards data-driven approaches, simple and complex models should be exploited differently. Simple models can be produced in a timely fashion to provide an estimation of the possible impacts. In contrast, complex models integrating real-world data require more time to develop but are far more realistic. The preparation of complicated modeling frameworks prior to the outbreaks is recommended, including the case of future Zika epidemic preparation. © 2018 Wiratsudakul et al."

Cancer vaccines developed in the past have had limited success and the mechanisms resulting in failure are not well characterized. To elucidate these mechanisms, we developed a human-parametrized, in silico, agent-based model of vaccination-driven CTL activation within a clinical short-peptide vaccination context. The simulations predict a sharp transition in the probability of CTL activation, which occurs with variation in the separation rate (or off-rate) of tumour-specific immune response-inducing peptides (cognate antigen) from the major histocompatibility class I (MHC-I) receptors of dendritic cells (DCs) originally at the vaccination site. For peptides with MHC-I off-rates beyond this transition, it is predicted that no vaccination strategy will lead to successful expansion of CTLs. For slower off-rates, below the transition, the probability of CTL activation becomes sensitive to the numbers of DCs and T cells that interact subsequent to DC migration to the draining lymph node of the vaccination site. Thus, the off-rate is a key determinant of vaccine design. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved."

Computational modeling may help to unfold the role of multiple evolving factors that exist and interact in the tumor microenvironment. Understanding these complex multiscale interactions is a crucial step toward predicting cancer growth and in developing effective therapies. We integrate different modeling approaches in a multiscale, avascular, hybrid tumor growth model encompassing tissue, cell, and sub-cell scales. At the tissue level, we consider the dispersion of nutrients and growth factors in the tumor microenvironment, which are modeled through reaction-diffusion equations. At the cell level, we use an agent-based model (ABM) to describe normal and tumor cell dynamics, with normal cells kept in homeostasis and cancer cells differentiated into quiescent, proliferative, migratory, apoptotic, hypoxic, and necrotic states. Cell movement is driven by the balance of a variety of forces according to Newton's second law, including those related to growth-induced stresses. Phenotypic transitions are defined by specific rule of behaviors that depend on microenvironment stimuli.We integrate in each cell/agent a branch of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway. This pathway is modeled by a system of coupled nonlinear differential equations involving the mass laws of 20 molecules. The rates of change in the concentration of some key molecules trigger proliferation or migration advantage response. The bridge between cell and tissue scales is built through the reaction and source terms of the partial differential equations. Our hybrid model is built in a modular way, enabling the investigation of the role of different mechanisms at multiple scales on tumor progression. This strategy allows representing both the collective behavior due to cell assembly as well as microscopic intracellular phenomena described by signal transduction pathways. Here, we investigate the impact of some mechanisms associated with sustained proliferation on cancer progression. Specifically, we focus on the intracellular proliferation/migration-Advantage-response driven by the EGFR pathway and on proliferation inhibition due to accumulation of growthinduced stresses. Simulations demonstrate that the model can adequately describe some complex mechanisms of tumor dynamics, including growth arrest in avascular tumors. Both the sub-cell model and growth-induced stresses give rise to heterogeneity in the tumor expansion and a rich variety of tumor behaviors."

Case studies include optimizing: egg shape given different clutch sizes, mate selection, migration of wildebeest, birds, and elk, vulture foraging behavior, algal bloom prediction, and species richness given energy constraints. Other case studies simulate the evolution of species and a means to project shifts in species ranges in response to a changing climate that includes competition and phenotypic plasticity. This introduction concludes by citing other uses of evolutionary computation and a review of the flexibility of the methods. For example, representing species' niche spaces subject to selective pressure allows studies on cladistics, the taxon cycle, neutral versus niche paradigms, fundamental versus realized niches, community structure and order of colonization, invasiveness, and responses to a changing climate. © The Author (2017).

As a response to climate change impacts in island communities, such as sea level rise, discounting the future can be a rational response due to increased stress on natural resources and uncertainty about whether future generations will have the same access to the same resources. By incorporating systematic responses of discount rates into models of resource conservation, realistic expectations of future human responses to climate change and associated resource stress may be developed. This paper illustrates the importance of time discounting through a theoretical agent-based model of resource use in island communities. A discount rate change can dramatically change projections about future migration and community-based conservation efforts. Our simulation results show that an increase in discount rates due to a credible information shock about future climate change impacts is likely to speed resource depletion. The negative impacts of climate change are therefore likely to be underestimated if changes in discount rates and emerging migration patterns are not taken into account. © Copyright Foundation for Environmental Conservation 2017."

In a spatial environment, with multiple locations with independent but inter-connected markets, these transitions quickly become complex and highly non-linear due to the feedback loops between the micro individual-level decisions and the meso location-wise market decisions. To capture these continuously evolving micro–meso interactions, this paper presents a spatially explicit bottom-up agent-based model to analyze natural disaster-like shocks to low-income regions. The aim of the model is to temporally and spatially track how population distributions, income, and consumption levels evolve, in order to identify low-income workers that are “food insecure”. The model is applied to the 2005 earthquake in northern Pakistan, which faced catastrophic losses and high levels of displacement in a short time span, and with market disruptions, resulted in high levels of food insecurity. The model is calibrated to pre-crisis trends, and shocked using distance-based output and labor loss functions to replicate the earthquake impact. Model results show, how various factors like existing income and saving levels, distance from the fault line, and connectivity to other locations, can give insights into the spatial and temporal emergence of vulnerabilities. The simulation framework presented here, leaps beyond existing modeling efforts, which usually deals with macro long-term loss estimates, and allows policy makers to come up with informed short-term policies in an environment where data is non-existent, policy response is time dependent, and resources are limited. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Traditionally, policy makers have concentrated on population control strategies by focussing on birth rates and rural–urban migration to stem the growth and emergence of slums. However, these strategies have often failed to achieve the desired results. In the present paper we find the key underlying processes that explains the observed differences in household life cycle between slum and non-slum households. We find that the slum households when compared to nonslum urban households, exhibit a large variation in the household size over the course of their life cycle, which in turn leads to inefficiency while building slum resettlement colonies. We have developed an agent based model, namely DynaSlum, to identify the key social determinants that impact the behaviour of a slum household. We use a novel and unique dataset based on the field work from 37 slums in Bangalore combined with the NFHS data to calibrate DynaSlum and validate our findings. This paper presents two major insights to address the challenges. First, we find that high rate of home leaving among young adults is the key determinants for the large variation in the life cycle of slum households. Second, we show that reducing home leaving among young adults will reduce the formation number of new slum households and contribute to a higher but stable household size. This will lead to efficiency and higher per capita resource consumption when building capacity for slum development (resettlement colonies) as policy makers would be able to plan for a stable household size. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Integrated particle system (IPS) models are a form of stochastic model that take spatial distributions, environmental factors, and agent migration into consideration. Unlike agent based models (ABM), IPS models only rely on a set of general reactions to describe the interactions of molecules/entities, allowing for an easy cause-effect connection between macroscopic phenomena and microscopic behavior. However, IPS models currently do not track individual agents or apply manipulations to individual agent behavior based on their specific location or their individual history. Therefore, IPS models cannot incorporate agent-based manipulations and tracking while still relying on a set of basic assumptions that are needed to easily connect emergent phenomena to simplistic microscopic behaviors. Here we propose an IPS modeling framework where we convert the exact Gillespie algorithm into a 2 dimensional lattice space that allows for environmental factors where molecules can move stochastically, generating an overall heterogeneous molecule distribution. Individual molecules can be tracked without describing the rules of interaction for each specific individual molecule, forming a tracked IPS (TIPS) modeling framework. However, since each individual molecule is tagged, agent-based manipulations and the ability to alter agent behavior due to history can be incorporated into TIPS, allowing one to model biological systems that would otherwise have to rely on a pure ABM. We apply the TIPS modeling framework to STIM1(stromal interaction molecule 1)-Orai1(calcium release-activated calcium channel protein 1) binding and motion, in T cells as a result of T cell receptor activation a key component of the calcium response within lymphocytes that leads to the adaptive response of T cells in an immune response. Within this biological setting we show that observed patterns of reduced motion following activation can be explained by a diffusion trap coming from changes in the environment of interaction without any real change in the molecules movement rates. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"

However, a comprehensive mechanobiological model to capture these spatiotemporal events and predict the growth and remodeling of an atherosclerotic artery is still lacking. Here, we present a multiscale model of leukocyte TEM and plaque evolution in the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. The approach integrates cellular behaviors via agent-based modeling (ABM) and hemodynamic effects via computational fluid dynamics (CFD). In this computational framework, the ABM implements the diffusion kinetics of key biological proteins, namely Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL), Tissue Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α), Interlukin-10 (IL-10) and Interlukin-1 beta (IL-1β), to predict chemotactic driven leukocyte migration into and within the artery wall. The ABM also considers wall shear stress (WSS) dependent leukocyte TEM and compensatory arterial remodeling obeying Glagov’s phenomenon. Interestingly, using fully developed steady blood flow does not result in a representative number of leukocyte TEM as compared to pulsatile flow, whereas passing WSS at peak systole of the pulsatile flow waveform does. Moreover, using the model, we have found leukocyte TEM increases monotonically with decreases in luminal volume. At critical plaque shapes the WSS changes rapidly resulting in sudden increases in leukocyte TEM suggesting lumen volumes that will give rise to rapid plaque growth rates if left untreated. Overall this multi-scale and multi-physics approach appropriately captures and integrates the spatiotemporal events occurring at the cellular level in order to predict leukocyte transmigration and plaque evolution. © 2017 Bhui, Hayenga."

Recent changes in stock structures, conditions and stock mixing between eastern and western Baltic cod can jeopardize the reliability of stock assessments and of the fishery economy. We modelled how different management, individual vessel decision-making, and stock growth and mixing scenarios have induced alternative individual vessel spatial effort allocation and economic performance by affecting fishing costs and by changing the relative stock abundance and size distribution. Stock mixing heavily influences profit and stock abundance for stocks that have experienced increased fishing mortality (F) levels. Western cod F has increased from a higher total allowed catches (TAC) advised in the medium-term due to the westward migration of eastern cod while eastern cod F has increased from reduced growth in the east. Greater pressures on western cod and decreased eastern cod growth and conditions greatly reduce the overall cod spawning stock biomass, thus changing the landing size composition and associated fishery profits. As a cumulative effect, fishing efforts are redirected towards western areas depending on management (quotas). However, total profits are less affected when traditional fishing opportunities and switching possibilities for other species and areas are maintained. Our evaluation indicates that current management mechanisms cannot correct for potential detrimental effects on cod fisheries when effort re-allocation changes landing origins. By investigating different economic starting conditions we further show that Baltic cod mis-management could have resulted in unintended unequal (skewed) impacts and serious consequences for certain fleets and fishing communities compared with others. Our management strategy evaluation is instrumental in capturing non-linear effects of different recommendations on sustainability and economic viability, and we show that fixed F-values management is likely not an attainable or sufficient goal in ensuring the sustainability and viability of fisheries and stocks given changing biological conditions. © International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2017.

In this study, a coupled hydrodynamic and agent-based approach is developed to characterise the transport behaviour of colony-forming Microcystis in a large shallow lake. Two models are combined: a hydrodynamic model to offer a basic flow field, and an agent-based model to incorporate the physiological response (buoyancy-controlling strategies) and migratory behaviour (horizontal advection and random-walk vertical mixing) of Micorcystis. The Meiliang Bay in Lake Taihu, which experiences high Microcystis blooms every year, was chosen as a case study to test the performance of this coupled approach. By comparing our coupled model with available field measurement, our results can reproduce changes in buoyancy status and three-dimensional distribution exposures to different wind intensities. Meanwhile, our coupled model shows more accurate results than the simulated results from traditional Eulerian approach. In shallow lake systems, strong wind (>6 m/s) can easily mix water column and keep most colonies buoyant. Subsequent gentle wind (<3 m/s) causes more intensive horizontal accumulation of these buoyant Microcystis in the downwind area than what happens under strong wind. Small colonies are readily dispersed by wind-induced turbulence and homogenized by local current circumstances. Diurnal temporary stratification and large colony sizes contribute to surface patches formation and downwind migration, leading to the heterogeneity of Microcystis bloom under the integrated effect of surface currents and wind drift. Therefore, the transport pattern of Microcystis colonies is a dynamic balance between turbulence and wind drift, along with buoyancy which is related to colony size. Overall, our combined model could be used to characterise the detailed movement patterns of Microcystis colonies or patches in large shallow lakes. © 2016"

The flexibility of agent-based models allows exploring mechanisms and feedback effects. However, this flexibility comes at a price, which is the problem of communicating and describing the model in a concise and transparent manner. There is no general agreement or culture yet on how agent-based models should be documented and described. Therefore, we want to contribute to the discussion on how agent-based models should be described in this position paper from a demographic perspective. Firstly we present and discuss the plethora of different ways to describe published agent-based models in population studies and demography. Subsequently, we argue that the ODD + D (Overview, Design, Details + Decisions) protocol is apt to address the specific difficulties which arise in describing demographic ABMs. We describe the main elements of the ODD + D protocol and subsequently present the results of an experiment illustrating its usefulness to describe an agent-based model of circular migration. We conclude that protocols such as the ODD + D are not only useful to compile a model description, but also serve as tool for the model developer to check if she has provided all necessary information that allows the reader to fully understand and replicate the model. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland."

Despite the overall national reduction in crime, Chicago's crime is still double the national average. And in the past year, Chicago's murder rate has been the worst since 1997. Therefore, methods of analyzing complex systems have become essential in predicting crime behavior and movement. Moreover, the interaction between criminals and their living environment, the correlation with the migration of people, and various circumstantial drivers are considered in building the model. The designed ABM will be validated by simulating various experimental scenarios, and comparing the results. From observing patterns across location, time, and crime type, behavior rules and individual adapting properties are determined by using the micro sequential rules. Ideally, the model will be valid, simple, and robust. In the end, a crime spread algorithm is proposed, which has the potential to be implemented to develop practical crime-prevention plans."

Vehicle ownership synthesis involves a multinomial logit model to determine the vehicle ownership level for the base year. The life-stages of the synthetic population are simulated longitudinally at a yearly simulation time-step within the iTLE framework. The simulated life-stages include: aging, birth, death, in-migration, out-migration, and household formation. The iTLE is coded in the C# DotNET programming platform. A 100% synthetic population is generated for Halifax, Canada. The baseline synthesis and life-stage simulation results are satisfactory.

This approach allows us to simulate an artificial society in a computer program taking into account the diversity of individuals under consideration, as well as to model a set of laws and rules of conduct that make up the institutional environment in which the members of this society live. A brief review and analysis of agent-based migration models presented in the foreign literature are given. The agent-based model of labour migration from China to Russia developed by the Central Economic Mathematical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences simulates human behaviour close to reality, which is based on their internal purposes, determining the agents choice of territory as a place of residence. Therefore, at the development of the agents of the model and their behaviour algorithms, as well as the organization of the environment in which they exist and interact, the main characteristics of the population of two neighbouring countries and their demographic processes have been considered. Using the model, two experiments have been conducted. The purpose of the first of them was to assess the effect of depreciation of the rubble against the yuan on the overall indexes of labour migration, as well as its structure. In the second experiment, the procedure of the search of the information by agents for the migratory decision-making was changing. Namely, all generalizing information on the average salary by types of activity and skill level of employees, both in China and Russia, became available to all agents irrespective of their qualification level."

This prompts questions about the role of a traditional, territorially-based notion of national identity during long-term displacement. Do refugees separated from home for generations still retain their national identities? Using an algorithm based on attitude shifts, we developed a theoretical model to represent identity shifts among long-term encamped refugees. Findings from the simulation indicate that refugees, due to the limited types of interactions they may encounter when confined to a camp, may experience identity shifts away from that of their home country, as well as away from territorial nationality.

The authors show that active usage of solar energy in Russia is possible at the rural household level, when the climate conditions are appropriate. Adoption of solar energy sources decreases the energy production based on the conventional sources and improves the quality of environment in the regions. A complex regional multi-agent model is considered in this paper. The model consists of several private models and uses GIS technologies. These private models are a demographic and migration model of the region and a diffusion of the innovations model. In these models, agents are humans who live within the boundaries of the agents-municipalities, and agents as well are large-scale producers of electricity that pollutes the environment. Such a structure allows us to determine the changes in the demand for electricity generated by traditional sources.

Yet key features of this process remain poorly understood, particularly how social behaviors intersected with demographic drivers to create the patterns of genomic diversity observed across Island Southeast Asia today. Such questions are ripe for computer modeling. Here, we construct an agent-based model to simulate human mobility across Island Southeast Asia from the Neolithic period to the present, with a special focus on interactions between individuals with Asian, Papuan, and mixed Asian-Papuan ancestry. Incorporating key features of the region, including its complex geography (islands and sea), demographic drivers (fecundity and migration), and social behaviors (marriage preferences), the model simultaneously tracks a full suite of genomic markers (autosomes, X chromosome, mitochondrial DNA, and Y chromosome). Using Bayesian inference, model parameters were determined that produce simulations that closely resemble the admixture profiles of 2299 individuals from 84 populations across Island Southeast Asia. The results highlight that greater propensity to migrate and elevated birth rates are related drivers behind the expansion of individuals with Asian ancestry relative to individuals with Papuan ancestry, that offspring preferentially resulted from marriages between Asian women and Papuan men, and that in contrast to current thinking, individuals with Asian ancestry were likely distributed across large parts of western Island Southeast Asia before the Neolithic expansion. © 2016 Vallée et al."

This study develops an agent-based model to simulate social and economic influences on neighborhood choice. With Danville, Illinois, as an empirical context, a pattern-oriented approach is employed to examine the role of social ties in shaping intraurban household mobility. In the model, household agents decide whether and where to relocate within the community based on factors such as neighborhood attractiveness, affordability, and the density of a household's social network in the prospective block group. Social network and neighborhood choices are encoded with logit utility functions. The relative influence of factors affecting the formation of social ties in the simulated social network, such as geographic proximity, similarity of income, race, and presence of children, are adjusted using parameter variation to create alternative model settings. Simulated migration patterns resulting from different network and neighborhood choice coefficients are compared with observed migration patterns over a two-year period. Based on 1,000 simulation experiments, a regression of homeowner migration error (the difference between simulated and observed migration) relative to the parameter settings revealed components of social network choice such as income, race, and probability of local ties to be significant in matching observed migration patterns. A nonlinear effect of simulated social networks on household mobility and thus migration error was exhibited in this study. © 2016 Taylor & Francis. All rights reserved."

Disaster management organizations (DMOs) are expected to contribute to ensuring this protection. However, what happens when their resources to cope with a flood are at stake or the intensity and frequency of the event exceeds their capacities? Many cities in the Free State of Saxony, Germany, were strongly hit by several floods in the last years and are additionally challenged by demographic change, with an ageing society and out-migration leading to population shrinkage in many parts of Saxony. Disaster management, which is mostly volunteer-based in Germany, is particularly affected by this change, leading to a loss of members. We propose an agent-based simulation model that acts as a ""virtual lab"" to explore the impact of various changes on disaster management performance. Using different scenarios we examine the impact of changes in personal resources of DMOs, their access to operation relevant information, flood characteristics as well as differences between geographic regions. A loss of DMOs and associated manpower caused by demographic change has the most profound impact on the performance. Especially in rural, upstream regions population decline in combination with very short lead times can put disaster management performance at risk. © 2016 Author(s). CC Attribution 3.0 License."

At least two dispersal events are documented, during which Pleistocene hominins left the African continent. Out of Africa 1 refers to the early hominin dispersal prior to Homo sapiens (e.g. Homo erectus/ergaster) while Out of Africa 2 deals with the dispersal of H. sapiens. Many hypotheses try to explain why early hominins dispersed beyond the African continent. Suggested causes include factors such as climate, geography, vegetation, demography, competition, ecology and cognition. However, no attempt has been made yet to model the hypotheses' mechanisms explicitly in order to compare them on a quantitative scale. We therefore explore the potential of agent-based modeling. An agent-based model consists of the acting entities, the so-called agents, an environment and rules of interaction among them. We analyzed the most common Out of Africa hypotheses and systematically formalized them by aid of an agent-based modeling framework. Our results show that the most common Out of Africa hypotheses can be attributed to at least four different scenarios. We refer to the scenarios as environmental, demographic, resource driven, ecology and cognition based scenarios. Our study provides a framework that helps designing agent-based models with respect to the dispersal of early hominins out of the African continent. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA"

The survey covers elements of hedonic models, spatial econometrics, neighbourhood models, housing market areas, housing supply, models of segregation, migration, housing tenure, subnational house price modelling including the so-called ripple effect, and agent-based models. Possible future directions are set in the context of a selection of recent papers that have appeared in Urban Studies. Nevertheless, there are still important gaps in the literature that merit further attention, arising at least partly from emerging policy problems. These include more research on housing and biodiversity, the relationship between housing and civil unrest, the effects of changing age distributions – notably housing for the elderly – and the impact of different international institutional structures.

The modeled refugees make decisions based on individual utility functions informed by two factors, speed of the group and group size.

Accordingly, a spatially-explicit agent-based ecological modeling, parallel simulation, and analysis environment called SEARUMS has been developed. However, the conservatively synchronized parallel simulation infrastructure of SEARUMS did not scale effectively. Furthermore, the initial multithreaded shared-memory design prevented utilization of resources on multiple compute nodes of a distributed memory cluster. Consequently, the simulation infrastructure of SEARUMS was redesigned to operate as a Time Warp synchronized parallel and distributed discrete event simulation (PDES) on modern distributed-memory supercomputing platforms. The new PDES environment is called SEARUMS++. The spatially-explicit nature of the models posed several challenges in achieving scalable and efficient PDES, necessitating new approaches in SEARUMS++ for: 1 modeling spatial interactions and initial partitioning of agents, 2 logical migration of an agent during simulation using proxy agents to reflect migratory characteristics, and 3 ghosting of agents using multiple proxy agents to handle boundary cases that occur during logical migration of agents. This article presents our optimization efforts involving new methods to address aforementioned challenges. The design of SEARUMS++ and experimental evaluation of various alternatives that were explored to achieve scalable and efficient PDES are also discussed. Our experiments indicate that SEARUMS++ provides 200% performance improvement and maintains scalability to a larger number of processors, thus enabling efficient parallel simulation of spatially-explicit agent-based epidemiological models. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This study applies scenario planning and agent-based modelling (ABM) to assess the potential impact of alternative management strategies on future suitability and functional connectivity of Cross River gorilla (CRG) habitat in the Nigeria-Cameroon border region. The CRG population is small and fragmented, with many subpopulations and migration corridors located outside protected areas. This study used ABM to simulate human land use in the study area over a period of 15 years under different management scenarios and assessed the impact on future suitability and functional connectivity of CRG habitat. The simulations showed that a landscape approach with greater focus on interventions to change human behaviour towards conserving gorillas and sustainable forest use would result in greater improvement in habitat suitability and functional connectivity compared to focusing on improving law enforcement within existing protected areas. However, the best scenarios were when both law enforcement and behaviour change increased. The results highlight the importance of human behaviour change to conservation in human-dominated landscapes and can inform conservation planning and management of other species and in similar landscapes.

These provide evidence for a marked increase in the archaeological signal 4000-3500 cal. BC followed by a distinct weakening. At the time, the climate was at its thermal maximum, which contributed positively to the terrestrial and marine ecosystem resources. In this paper we aim to find out the processes behind the increased size of the human population by employing agent and equation-based modelling.

However, it is not well understood how riverscapes, with their complex architectures, affect patterns of neutral genetic diversity. Using a spatially explicit agent-based modeling (ABM) approach, we evaluate the genetic consequences of dendritic river shapes on local population structure. We disentangle the relative contribution of specific river properties to observed patterns of genetic variation by evaluating how different branching architectures and downstream flow regimes affect the genetic structure of populations situated within river networks. Irrespective of the river length, our results illustrate that the extent of river branching, confluence position, and levels of asymmetric downstream migration dictate patterns of genetic variation in riverine populations. Comparisons between simple and highly branched rivers show a 20-fold increase in the overall genetic diversity and a sevenfold increase in the genetic differentiation between local populations. Given that most rivers have complex architectures, these results highlight the importance of incorporating riverscape information into evolutionary models of aquatic species and could help explain why riverine fishes represent a disproportionately large amount of global vertebrate diversity per unit of habitable area. © 2016, Society for the Study of Evolution."

Optimal foraging theory predicts that such animals should spend more time in patches that enable them to maximise the net rate of energy and nutrient gain. The type of search strategy employed by animals is, however, expected to depend on the amount of information that is involved in the search process. In highly dynamic landscapes, animals are unlikely to have complete knowledge about the distribution of the resources, which makes them unable to forage on the patches that enable them to maximise their net energy intake. Random search may, however, be a good strategy in landscapes where patches with profitable resources are abundant. We present simulation experiments using an individual-based model (IBM) to test which foraging decision rule (FDR) best reproduces the population patterns observed in pink-footed geese during spring staging in an agricultural landscape in Mid-Norway. Our results suggested that while geese employed a random search strategy, they were also able to individually learn where the most profitable patches were located and return to the patches that resulted in highest energy intake. Such asocial learning is rarely reported for flock animals. The modelled geese did not benefit from group foraging, which contradicts the results reported by most studies on flocking birds. Geese also did not possess complete knowledge about the profitability of the available habitat. Most likely, there is no one single optimal foraging strategy for capital breeders but such strategy is site and species-specific.

While traditional migration models can be used, more sophisticated and advanced models are required to capture various factors influencing the displacement process and the complex interactions and behaviour of various agents that force people to make displacement decisions. Agent-based modeling (ABM) has emerged as a preferred modeling method for complex social and environmental problems including forced displacement and migration.

With conventional treatment, the median survival time is typically 3â€""4 years, although it can be extended to 5â€""7 years or longer with advanced treatments. Recent research indicated that an increase in osteoclast (OC) activity is often associated withmultiple myeloma (MM) and that a decrease inosteoblast (OB) activity contributesto the osteolytic lesions in MM. Normally, the populations of OCs and OBs are inequilibrium, and an imbalance in this statecontributes to the development of lesions. Research procedures A multi-scale agent-based multiple myeloma model was developed to simulate the proliferation, migration and death of OBs and OCs. Subsequently, this model was employed to investigate the efficacy of thethree most commonly used drugs for MM treatment under the following two premises: the reduction in the progression of MM and the re-establishment of the equilibrium between OCs and OBs. Research purposes The simulated results not only demonstrated the capacity of the model to choose optimal combinations of the drugs but also showed that the optimal use of the three drugs can restore the balance between OCs and OBs as well as kill MMs. Furthermore, the drug synergism analysis function of the model revealed that restoring the balance between OBs and OCs can significantly increase the efficacy of drugs against tumor cells. © 2015 Qiao et al.

In this paper, we present a hybrid continuum-discrete agent-based model to provide quantitative insight into the properties of cell symmetric and asymmetric division on the spatial and developing cell rearrangement within the TEB during ductal elongation. An interplay of endocrine-paracrine signaling and cell lineage has been implemented in the model. Our results show that higher symmetric division rates resulted in more progenitor cells remaining in the TEB, while lower rates resulted in more differentiated cells in the TEB. Moreover, pure proliferation alone was enough to result in ductal elongation in the absence of any cellular migration, a result consistent with current experimental data. This model can also serve as a platform to study how mutation-induced phenotypic changes contribute to developmental defects in mammary gland development. © 2015 IEEE."

We propose to advance the science in the existing network migration models by considering additional critical factors, including (1) synergistic relationships across multiple technologies, (2) reduction in operational expenditures as a reason to migrate, and (3) implications of local network effects on migration decisions. To this end, we propose a novel agent-based migration model considering these factors. Based on the model, we analyze the case study of network migration to two emerging networking paradigms, i.e., IETF Path Computation Element (PCE) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN). We validate our model using extensive simulations. Our results demonstrate the synergistic effects of migration to multiple complementary technologies, and show that a technology migration may be eased by the joint migration to multiple technologies. In particular, we find that migration to SDN can be eased by joint migration to PCE, and that the benefits derived from SDN are best exploited in combination with PCE, than by itself. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Although clustering of these cells is commonly observed in vitro, it is not yet known whether clustering results from long-range signaling (e.g., chemotaxis) or short-range interactions (e.g., differential adhesion). To determine the mechanism behind clustering, we used experimental and computational modeling to determine the individual contributions of long-range and short-range interactions. Experimentally, the migration of PANC-1 cells on tissue culture treated plastic was tracked by time-lapse microscopy with or without a central cluster of cells that could act as a concentrated source of some long-range signal. Cell migration data was analyzed in terms of distance, number of steps, and migration rate in each direction, as well as migration rate as a function of distance from the cluster. Results did not indicate directed migration toward a central cluster (p > 0.05). Computationally, an agent-based model was used to demonstrate the plausibility of clustering by short-range interactions only. In the presence of random cell migration, this model showed that a high, but not maximal, cell–cell adhesion probability and minimal cell–substrate adhesion probability supported the greatest islet-like cluster formation. © 2015, Biomedical Engineering Society."

Adult subventricular neurogenesis results in migration of neuronal precursors from subventricular zone to the olfactory bulb through the rostral migratory stream where they get converted to neurons. In this paper, we present a deterministic model of adult subventricular neurogenesis. This model captures the essence of neurogenesis by incorporating the neural stem cells, rapidly proliferating intermediate cells and the neurons. It also captures radial dispersion of neurons into the olfactory bulb. Our model incorporates stem cell death (apoptosis) over certain number of stem cell divisions resulting into reduction in the generation of neurons with time, which mimics aging. It demonstrates the steady production of sufficient number of neurons. We prove that our model of adult subventricular neurogenesis is biologically feasible and it overcomes the limitations of previously reported models. We believe that our model will help in devising experiments to further improve the understanding of adult subventricular neurogenesis.We have performed agent based simulation of the model proposed in this paper.

In this paper, we derive a simple agent-based model to describe the migration and the orientation of endothelial cells seeded on bioactive micropatterned polymers. The aim of the modeling is to provide a simple model that corroborates quantitatively the experiments, without considering the complex phenomena inherent to cell migration. Our model is obtained thanks to a classical mechanics approach based on experimental observations. Even though its simplicity, it provides numerical results that are quantitatively in accordance with the experimental data, and thus our approach can be seen as a preliminary way towards a simple modeling of cell migration."

Raptor behavior and demography are especially difficult to monitor, but models of movement can provide information toward this goal. The golden eagle (. Aquila chrysaetos) in eastern North America is an apex predator of regional conservation concern, and little is known about its population ecology, movements, or behavior. We designed an agent-based model to simulate autumn migration of eagles in Pennsylvania, USA. Inputs to the model included information on regional topography, known flight behaviors (i.e. slope-soaring and thermal-soaring and gliding), estimated uplift, and a principal axis of migration. In total, we modeled 6094 flight routes, averaging 2191 (±1281; ±SD; range: 3-5373) moves. Simulations were spatially comparable to historic flight route data collected via telemetry and generally followed topography that provided uplift. In our model, orographic uplift available to migrant eagles was stronger and more frequent than thermal uplift, and uplift forms were not correlated with one another (. r=. -0.145). Modeled golden eagle migration in autumn follows a narrow-front pattern as individuals are concentrated in areas that produce orographic uplift. Simulated flights were more concentrated on days when historic counts of golden eagles were high at monitoring sites. In contrast, simulations were more dispersed on days when fewer actual eagles were recorded. We used output from our simulations to select new sites that could be used for monitoring migratory raptors. Relatively large numbers of golden eagles were observed at these sites, thus validating performance of our model. This work identifies a novel, cost-effective method for modeling migration patterns of and furthering conservation goals for a rare, low-density raptor species. © 2015 Elsevier B.V."

This approach can be subjected to strong criticism as substantial aspects of the biological system being captured are not currently known, meaning assumptions need to be made that could have a critical impact on simulation response. We have utilised the CoSMoS process in the development of an agent-based simulation of the formation of Peyer’s patches (PP), gut-associated lymphoid organs that have a key role in the initiation of adaptive immune responses to infection. Although the use of genetic tools, imaging technologies and ex vivo culture systems has provided significant insight into the cellular components and associated pathways involved in PP development, interesting questions remain that cannot be addressed using these approaches, and as such well justified assumptions have been introduced into our model to counter this. Here we focus not on the development of the model itself, but instead demonstrate how the resultant simulation can be used to assess how these assumptions impact the simulation response. For example, we consider the impact of our assumption that the migration rate of lymphoid tissue cells into the gut remains constant throughout PP development. We demonstrate that an analysis of the assumptions made in the construction of the domain model may either increase confidence in the model as a representation of the biological system it captures, or may suggest areas where further biological experimentation is required. © 2014, The Author(s)."

Guidance regarding the relevance of the CUE from the upper echelons of Defence with Chief of Army endorsement, can be found in the Modernisation and Strategic Planning Division Staff's Future Land Warfare Report (FLWR) (MSPD-Staff, 2014), and in Kilcullen's (2014) “The Australian Army in the Urban Networked Littoral”. Both echo a similar message that future military operations are most likely to be held in highly networked littoral CUE, where the degree of complexity of such environments is far beyond that of conventional force-on-force engagement. With regard to the operating environment FLWR (MSPD-Staff, 2014) indicates that the environment for future operations has five meta-trends; crowded, connected, lethal, collective, constrained. The term 'crowded' encompasses a range of factors that interplay to create complex human, informational and urban physical terrain, including urbanisation, rural to urban migration, population growth, resource scarcity and environmental and regional political instability. The term 'connected' refers to the flattening effect of the interconnected global economic, social and communications systems. It is Kilcullen's (2014) seminal observation, that the central novel feature is the highly networked nature of the urban world, which encompasses complex flow systems of trade, people, idea-systems, information with competition for not only territory, consisting of the natural land and built environs, but the built environment services such as, water, electricity, transportation, communication and the like. The competition does not, however, stop there; it is also a competition for idea-systems in what some have called the “battle for ideas” (Clarke, 2004). Many interrelated factors contribute toward population movements toward littoral mega-cities, upon whose physical terrain, exist turbulent seas of complex flowing dynamic topologies which we term the human-terrain. This discussion paper attempts to start an exploration of the issues involved in studying violent conflict in the uncertain complex CUE. A small multi-disciplinary-team has been formed within LD and JOAD with an initial focus on the Knowledge Representation (KR) of littoral urban environments for highly networked actors within an Agent Based Model (ABM) and other simulations. We suggest, based on previous work of Johnson and Ivancevic (2013; 2015), two psychological constructs which may well be applicable to ABM for either beauty of KR or computational efficiency. The current work is being conducted as a horizon survey within the frame of unbounded systems thinking (UST) due to Mitroff and Linstone (1993). With regard to world views, in addition to the traditional perspective of science/technology, the Technical T perspective, two other perspectives are taken into account in deciding what action to take next. They are the Organisational O perspective of the social-entity and the Personal P perspective of the self/individuation. It is a challenging approach in which everything is connected to everything and none of the sciences or professions involved in a study is considered fundamental. Against this frame the sociological stance is considered at some length and seven basic aspects of sociological theory are introduced (Macionis and Gerber, 2010); culture, society, socialisation, social interaction in everyday life, groups and organisations, sexuality and society and finally deviance. We recommend that in highly networked urban environment that the sociology discipline be considered for modelling social-interactions, including emotions and language, within and between various social-groups for studies of future military operations within CUE. Finally, some difficult questions, from a UST point of view, are raised for using ABMs with respect to making progress towards defence outcomes. © 2020 Proceedings - 21st International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2015.

Exploring how the built environment might change over time is an essential element for assessing changing risks. This chapter presents and discusses two algorithm-based approaches used in the Tyndall Coastal Simulator to analyse local changes in residential and other urban land uses. The first approach uses multi-criteria analysis (MCA) to calculate spatial weights based on a number of attracting features such as transport, existing development, flood risk and proximity to the coast to identify the development patterns under different socio-economic futures. The second method uses agent-based modelling (ABM) to examine interactions between residential households and local planners as a demand–supply process that produces possible development patterns under different socio-economic futures. The core elements of this model are the location preferences of (changing) individual residential agents and the constraints imposed by planners through land-use policy. The MCA method is simpler than the ABM method and useful for developing and realising socio-economic scenarios because of its flexibility and the possibility of quick implementation and adjustment. As a result, the MCA method is easy to implement, and it provides flexible tools that can be used for first-step socio-economic scenario development. While the MCA method requires fewer input variables, the ABM method is better able to account for feedbacks between governance processes, individual choices and external changes such as migration. The ABM is more sophisticated and more detailed and so provides a comprehensive approach that considers both location preferences and planning policies. The ABM method captures local behaviour and the iterative characteristics of urban dynamics. For both models, the key outputs are plausible distributions (scenarios) of urban dwellings in East Anglia over the twenty-first century under four different socio-economic storylines (see also Appendix A). Both methods are relevant to the process of risk assessment of climate change, and both have much scope for improvement, e.g. including brownfield sites and change in vertical as well as horizontal urban densities.

This review offers a comprehensive biological background followed by comparative analysis of recent models of locust collective motion, in particular locust marching, their settings, and underlying assumptions. We describe a wide range of recent modeling and simulation approaches, from discrete agent-based models of self-propelled particles to continuous models of integro-differential equations, aimed at describing and analyzing the fascinating phenomenon of locust collective motion. These modeling efforts have a dual role: The first views locusts as a quintessential example of animal collective motion. As such, they aim at abstraction and coarse-graining, often utilizing the tools of statistical physics. The second, which originates from a more biological perspective, views locust swarming as a scientific problem of its own exceptional merit. The main goal should, thus, be the analysis and prediction of natural swarm dynamics. We discuss the properties of swarm dynamics using the tools of statistical physics, as well as the implications for laboratory experiments and natural swarms. Finally, we stress the importance of a combined-interdisciplinary, biological-theoretical effort in successfully confronting the challenges that locusts pose at both the theoretical and practical levels. © 2015 Ariel, Ayali."

Housing location decision making is a complex process driven by the interactions between the housing market and home searchers. Researchers have paid much attention to the environmental, socioeconomic, cultural, and policy features of housing markets. In contrast, housing search has been relatively neglected due to challenges of theory, methodology, and data. This article addresses these challenges by presenting an agent-based model of intraurban migration featuring straightforward and empirically specified rules for housing search. This model is calibrated and validated against real-world housing vacancies and relocation origin–destination pairs extracted from parcel records for the Twin Cities of Minnesota, USA, for 2005–2007. Drawing on these unique data sidesteps a long-standing issue, the prohibitive costs of identifying, recording, and quantifying housing search activities for an entire metropolitan region. Conceptually, this model updates geographic theories of intraurban migration that focus on intervening opportunities and spatial bias. It also methodologically advances the agent-based modeling of urbanization with a high-resolution, empirically specified model that demonstrates how urban pattern emerges from simple rules and interactions. Overall, the model demonstrates that relatively straightforward housing search rules can simulate realistic patterns of intraurban migration. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015."

Successful mitigation of epidemics requires coordinated, well-planned intervention strategies that are specific to the pathogen, transmission modality, population, and available resources. Modeling and simulation in the field of computational epidemiology provides predictions of expected outcomes that are used by public policy planners in setting response strategies. Developing up to date models of population structures, daily activities, and movement has proven challenging for developing countries due to limited governmental resources. Recent collaborations (in 2012 and 2014) with telecom providers have given public health researchers access to Big Data needed to build high-fidelity models. Researchers now have access to billions of anonymized, detailed call data records (CDR) of mobile devices for several West African countries. In addition to official census records, these CDR datasets provide insights into the actual population locations, densities, movement, travel patterns, and migration in hard to reach areas. These datasets allow for the construction of population, activity, and movement models. For the first time, these models provide computational support of health related decision making in these developing areas (via simulation-based studies). New models, datasets, and simulation software were produced to assist in mitigating the continuing outbreak of Ebola. Existing models of disease characteristics, propagation, and progression were updated for the current circulating strain of Ebola. The simulation process required the interactions of multi-scale models, including viral loads (at the cellular level), disease progression (at the individual person level), disease propagation (at the workplace and family level), societal changes in migration and travel movements (at the population level), and mitigating interventions (at the abstract governmental policy level). The predictive results from this system were validated against results from the CDC's high-level predictions. © The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V."

The early immune response in human blood comprises the elimination of pathogens by antimicrobial peptides and innate immune cells, such as neutrophils or monocytes. Mathematical modeling is a predictive method to examine these complex processes and to quantify the dynamics of pathogen-host interactions. Since model parameters are often not directly accessible from experiment, their estimation is required by calibrating model predictions with experimental data. Depending on the complexity of the mathematical model, parameter estimation can be associated with excessively high computational costs in terms of run time and memory. We apply a strategy for reliable parameter estimation where different modeling approaches with increasing complexity are used that build on one another. This bottom-up modeling approach is applied to an experimental human whole-blood infection assay for Candida albicans. Aiming for the quantification of the relative impact of different routes of the immune response against this human-pathogenic fungus, we start from a non-spatial state-based model (SBM), because this level of model complexity allows estimating a priori unknown transition rates between various system states by the global optimization method simulated annealing. Building on the non-spatial SBM, an agent-based model (ABM) is implemented that incorporates the migration of interacting cells in three-dimensional space. The ABM takes advantage of estimated parameters from the non-spatial SBM, leading to a decreased dimensionality of the parameter space. This space can be scanned using a local optimization approach, i.e., least-squares error estimation based on an adaptive regular grid search, to predict cell migration parameters that are not accessible in experiment. In the future, spatio-temporal simulations of whole-blood samples may enable timely stratification of sepsis patients by distinguishing hyper-inflammatory from paralytic phases in immune dysregulation. © 2015 Lehnert, Timme, Pollmächer, Hünniger, Kurzai and Figge."

In the lung, it is able to quickly adapt to the humid environment and, if not removed within a time frame of 4-8 h, the pathogen may cause damage by germination and invasive growth. Applying a to-scale agent-based model of human alveoli to simulate early A. fumigatus infection under physiological conditions, we recently demonstrated that alveolar macrophages require chemotactic cues to accomplish the task of pathogen detection within the aforementioned time frame. The objective of this study is to specify our general prediction on the as yet unidentified chemokine by a quantitative analysis of its expected properties, such as the diffusion coefficient and the rates of secretion and degradation. To this end, the rule-based implementation of chemokine diffusion in the initial agent-based model is revised by numerically solving the spatio-temporal reaction-diffusion equation in the complex structure of the alveolus. In this hybrid agent-based model, alveolar macrophages are represented as migrating agents that are coupled to the interactive layer of diffusing molecule concentrations by the kinetics of chemokine receptor binding, internalization and re-expression. Performing simulations for more than a million virtual infection scenarios, we find that the ratio of secretion rate to the diffusion coefficient is the main indicator for the success of pathogen detection. Moreover, a subdivision of the parameter space into regimes of successful and unsuccessful parameter combination by this ratio is specific for values of the migration speed and the directional persistence time of alveolar macrophages, but depends only weakly on chemokine degradation rates. © 2015 Pollmächer and Figge."

Since the 19th century, many theories have been applied to the study of international migration phenomena. These theories cover sociological, economical, and cultural aspects. All the theories aim at estimating the magnitude of population movements. Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are presented as a new methodological approach to model and foresee the process of migration. This article discusses how legal aspects can also be treated from a computational point of view. When a migrant reaches the border checkpoint, he/she must deal with the legislation of the destination country, which is applied by the border security police. This interaction at the microlevel between the migrant and the border agent is based on the definition of a behavioral model that includes the migrant's profile, the border officer's profile, and the legislation that rules the border crossing. With this model, the effects at the macrolevel of new policies (which are usually difficult to predict) can be estimated. Changes in legislation or in strictness in applying the existing law at certain borders can influence migration trends; for example, the choice of route. This study presents the main features of the computational model that has been developed to recreate the border-crossing scenario in a Multi-Agent System. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Here, we investigate stem cell seeding to an avascular tumour site using an agent-based stochastic model of breast cancer metastatic seeding. The model includes several important cellular features such as stem cell symmetric and asymmetric division, migration, cellular quiescence, senescence, apoptosis and cell division cycles. It also includes external features such as stem cell seeding frequency and location. Using this model, we find that cell seeding rate and location are important features for tumour growth. We also define conditions in which the tumour growth exhibits decremented and exponential growth patterns.

Several modeling paradigms can be used to describe system behavior. Agent-based modeling provides an efficient and powerful environment to represent characteristics at organ, cellular, and subcellular levels, enables interactions of various components of a system based on events triggered during a simulation, and tracks dynamic information of individual entities. Agents are individual building blocks that are capable of performing various actions independently based on both their own perception of their environment, and the quantitative and qualitative rules that govern their behavior. Three-dimensional tissue engineering where angiogenesis and tissue growth occur in a scaffold illustrates agent-based modeling and its use for supervision of tissue growth, prediction of the final tissue properties, and regulation of the growth process for the desired final tissue. Time series models offer an alternative modeling paradigm and generate input-output (blackbox) models that have been successful in supervision and control of complex processes.

The primary purpose of this paper is to examine the development and evolution of China's spatial structure under different traffic systems and its influence on the regional economy and interactions, such as technology diffusion and capital flow. This information is important because we need to explore various measures to improve the imbalanced economic development in China. In this study, unlike in previous structure researches, an agent-based dynamic regional economic model is built from the perspective of bottom-up modeling. In this model, each prefecture-level city in China has been defined as a firm agent, and the Cobb-Douglas production function is adopted. Heterogeneous laborer agents with different technology levels move between firm agents. The laborer migration behavior is affected by Wilson spatial attenuation. The technologies diffuse with the process of laborer migration. Capital also moves between agents as an investment behavior of firms. Different types of roads are endowed with different weights to form a heterogeneous traffic network in this model. A simulation system is built to combine GIS components. Three scenarios are identified to account for the effects of the hierarchical traffic network and preferential tax policies on the evolution of Chinese regional structure. The simulated results indicate that the traditional center-hinterland diffusion mode is no longer appropriate under the impact of heterogeneous traffic network in reality. The technologies firstly diffuse from center cities to sub-hubs along the major traffic lines, following a hub-net diffusion structure, and later from sub-hubs to ordinary nodes located at the branch lines. This phenomenon can also be observed in the capital flow process, in which the capital hubs first interconnect and form a capital flow network along the major traffic roads. After that, the network extends to adjacent ordinary nodes. It is also demonstrated that traffic conditions are important for regional development and that the basic spatial lock-in created by the natural endowments still exists. A preferential tax policy can break such a spatial lock-in to a certain extent and will be conductive to attracting the immigration of laborers and improving the local technology level for less developed regions."

We explore management strategies aimed at maintaining one of two goals - local or global coexistence of species. To achieve their goal, the manager varies the connectivity between patches based on one of three strategies - the monitoring of predator, prey, or the vegetation carrying capacity of the patches.

A preliminary agrarian system analysis of the study site (LamDome Yai watershed in Southern Ubon Ratchathani Province) suggested to define three main types of farminghouseholds according to their agro-ecological constraints and opportunities, farming practices, and socioeconomicstrategies. To reflect this typology, a group of 11 farming households were selected. The wives andhusbands of each household were involved in the co-design of the conceptual ABM through a series of fieldworkshops based on role-playing games (15-18 participants). To specify the rule-based algorithms related to ricecropping activities, a smaller group (6-10 participants) engaged in the design of UML activity diagrams.Implemented with the Cormas platform, the corresponding computer simulation model was introduced to theparticipating farmers. Showcasing the “business-as-usual” scenario enabled to fine tune the calibration and themeans of observation. The participants were then requested to suggest scenarios of interest to them to beexplored with the model. In this 4-year long process, the successive use of role-playing games, UML activitydiagrams and computer simulations with the participating farmers accounted for about two-thirds of the varioussources of information (as a complement to the one-third represented by farm surveys and secondary data) usedto specify the model. It resulted in increasing the sense of ownership of the model by the farmers. At completionof the process, a special seminar was organized at the regional Faculty of Agriculture of Ubon RatchathaniUniversity during which four collaborative farmers presented and discussed at length “their” model in front ofseventy graduate students and faculty staff. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014."

Cxcr7b-mediated degradation of Cxcl12a by trailing cells generates a local gradient of Cxcl12a that guides PLLp migration. Agent-based computer models were built to explore how a polarized response to Cxcl12a, mediated by Cxcr4b in leading cells and prevented by Cxcr7b in trailing cells, determines unidirectional migration of the PLLp. These chemokine signaling-based models effectively recapitulate many behaviors of the PLLp and provide potential explanations for the characteristic behaviors that emerge when the PLLp is severed by laser to generate leading and trailing fragments. As predicted by our models, the bilateral stretching of the leading fragment is lost when chemokine signaling is blocked in the PLLp. However, movement of the trailing fragment toward the leading cells, which was also thought to be chemokine dependent, persists. This suggested that a chemokine-independent mechanism, not accounted for in our models, is responsible for this behavior. Further investigation of trailing cell behavior shows that their movement toward leading cells depends on FGF signaling and it can be re-oriented by exogenous FGF sources. Together, our observations reveal the simple yet elegant manner in which leading and trailing cells coordinate migration; while leading cells steer PLLp migration by following chemokine cues, cells further back play follow-the-leader as they migrate toward FGFs produced by leading cells. © 2014.

This paper presents a multi-disciplinary methodology to researching and modeling population displacement in a broad, yet inclusive sweep. An Environment Matrix and an Agent Matrix are presented that can be used as a template to develop an agent-based model to capture this phenomenon. These matrices facilitate an accurate representation of an environment and a thorough characterization of agents. The crisis in Syria serves as a use-case for matrix development.

We present an agent-based model showing that there is a close relationship between level of foresight, environmental heterogeneity, and population dispersibility. We explore the dynamics between these three factors and discuss how they may affect the capacity of a hominin population to disperse. Generally, we find that high levels of environmental heterogeneity select for increased foresight and that high levels of foresight tend to reduce dispersibility. This suggests that cognitively complex hominins in heterogeneous environments have low dispersibility relative to cognitively less complex organisms in more homogeneous environments. The model predicts that the environments leading up to major episodes of dispersal, such as the initial hominin dispersal into Eurasia, were likely relatively low in spatial heterogeneity and that the dispersing hominins had relatively low foresight. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd."

Drawing upon the literature on the process of developing and parameterizing a social simulation in the absence of spatio-temporal data, the paper outlines the translation of the conceptual framework into a working agent-based model. The possible impact of a change in local rainfall variability and mean upon household income, food production, and therefore the resilience and migration of members, is simulated to permit consideration of the possible impact of the artificial scenarios tested. In addition to the influence of changing rainfall, other non-rainfall scenarios are tested to explore the scale of the changes simulated. It is proposed that while a relatively clear impact of rainfall scenarios upon household resilience is simulated, the impact upon migration of household members is generally less clear. Furthermore, demographic and societal changes to the model are also seen to clearly contribute to the simulation outputs generated. The paper concludes that RABMM-T offers the first step in developing a potentially valuable resource for producing comparable migration forecasts that consider a range of contributory mechanisms. However, careful parameterization is required to ensure the quality and value of model outputs. © 2014 © 2014 The Author(s). Published by Taylor & Francis."

Further, in the context of climate change, scholarly literature on migration ranges across a host of climatic stressors and geographies, making it difficult to date to solve the debate whether migration is a form of adaptation or an indicator of limits to adaptation. To address both of these debates, original research was undertaken to answer the question 'under what circumstances do households (HHs) use migration as a risk management strategy when facing rainfall variability and food insecurity?'. This research administered a HH survey (n = 1300) and participatory research (n = 2000 respondents) in districts in eight countries (Guatemala, Peru, Ghana, Tanzania, Bangladesh, India, Thailand, and Vietnam). The findings reveal that the answer to how climatic stressors affect migration decisions and the degree to which migration improves the adaptive capacity of those HHs lie in the vulnerability of the HH and its sensitivity to climatic factors. The data reveal for the first time in a comparable global study distinct HH profiles of 'resilience' and 'vulnerability'. At the same time, the article distinguishes between 'content' migration - rather associated with resilient HHs - and 'erosive' migration - rather associated with vulnerable HHs. However, the article also highlights that there are not always clear cuts but very often grey areas and overlaps among the HHs of the study when applying these typologies. Moreover, the article relates these profiles to an agent-based modelling approach applied in the Tanzania case to explore under what scenarios rainfall variability and food security have the potential to become significant drivers of human mobility in particular regions of the world in the next two to three decades. © 2013 © 2013 The Author(s).

Individual learning, unbiased and biased social learning, mixed learning, and learning schedules are considered. A rapidly changing environment or frequent migration in a spatially heterogeneous environment favors individual learning over unbiased social learning. However, results are not so straightforward in the context of learning schedules or when biases in social learning are introduced. The three major methods of modeling temporal environmental change-coevolutionary, two-timescale, and information decay-are compared and shown to sometimes yield contradictory results. The so-called Rogers' paradox is inherent in the two-timescale method as originally applied to the evolution of pure strategies, but is often eliminated when the other methods are used. Moreover, Rogers' paradox is not observed for the mixed learning strategies and learning schedules that we review. We believe that further theoretical work is necessary on learning schedules and biased social learning, based on models that are logically consistent and empirically pertinent. © 2013 Elsevier Inc."

This study develops an agent-based model to simulate social and economic influences on neighborhood choice. With Danville, Illinois, as an empirical context, a pattern-oriented approach is employed to examine the role of social ties in shaping intraurban household mobility. In the model, household agents decide whether and where to relocate within the community based on factors such as neighborhood attractiveness, affordability, and the density of a household's social network in the prospective block group. Social network and neighborhood choices are encoded with logit utility functions. The relative influence of factors affecting the formation of social ties in the simulated social network, such as geographic proximity, similarity of income, race, and presence of children, are adjusted using parameter variation to create alternative model settings. Simulated migration patterns resulting from different network and neighborhood choice coefficients are compared with observed migration patterns over a two-year period. Based on 1,000 simulation experiments, a regression of homeowner migration error (the difference between simulated and observed migration) relative to the parameter settings revealed components of social network choice such as income, race, and probability of local ties to be significant in matching observed migration patterns. A nonlinear effect of simulated social networks on household mobility and thus migration error was exhibited in this study. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

There has been an extensive attention focused on the reproduction of smart agent actions in the framework of agent based modeling. This paper reviews how to combine Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Neural Networks (NN) to simulate evacuation in a goal finding application. The agents have the aptitude to adjust their actions in the situation and devise their reaction by gleaning knowledge from their surroundings. The approach is based on role based collaboration between individual agents as well as between groups of agents. As the agents receive feedback from their environment, they are able to change how they act as they try to achieve their goals. A crowd-modeling and disaster conduct modeling ability is been developed in a goal finding application. This paper studies clever agent-based migrations that can help in the layout of building meeting places and directing designers on achieving a higher probability of efficiency and maximized use of these structures. The findings of this modeling was very encouraging as the agents are able to assume various roles to combine GA and NN on the way to reaching their goals."

The agent/agent interactions are carried out by their social otherwise, the agent/environment interactions are expressed through the consumption of ecological resources in repression and satisfaction by social behaviours of the agent. In this work, we will present the structure and the formulation of our model. This model can capture emergent social phenomena such as globalization and polarization, and it can help to understand the social migration process. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

The final steps of this modeling effort are expressed in a code written in a programing language. On account of the complete lack of standardization of the different steps to proceed, we have to deplore poor communication and sharing between experimentalists, theoreticians and programmers. The adoption of diagrammatic visual computer language should however greatly help the immunologists to better communicate, to more easily identify the models similarities and facilitate the reuse and extension of existing software models. Since immunologists often conceptualize the dynamical evolution of immune systems in terms of ""state-transitions"" of biological objects, we promote the use of unified modeling language (UML) state-transition diagram. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we present a UML refactoring of two published models on thymocyte differentiation. Originally built with different modeling strategies, a mathematical ordinary differential equation-based model and a cellular automata model, the two models are now in the same visual formalism and can be compared. The perspective is to encourage immunologists involved into mathematical modeling or software productions, to adopt a visual graphical language, here mainly the unified modeling language (UML) ""state-transition"" diagram to ease the communication, the reuse and the extension of their models. © 2013 Thomas-Vaslin, Six, Ganascia and Bersini."

We then review continuum and agent-based (cellular automata) models with rules of cell movement and logistical proliferation. Both movement and proliferation at the individual cell level are modeled with stochastic components from which stereotyped outcomes emerge at the population level. These models reproduced the wave-like colonization of the intestine by enteric neural crest cells, and several new properties emerged, such as colonization by frontal expansion, which were later confirmed biologically. These models predict a surprising level of clonal heterogeneity both in terms of number and distribution of daughter cells. Biologically, migrating cells form stable chains made up of unstable cells, but this is not seen in the initial model. We outline additional rules for cell differentiation into neurons, axon extension, cell-axon and cell-cell adhesions, chemotaxis and repulsion which can reproduce chain migration. After the migration stage, the cells re-arrange as a network of ganglia. Changes in cell adhesion molecules parallel this, and we describe additional rules based on Steinberg's Differential Adhesion Hypothesis, reflecting changing levels of adhesion in neural crest cells and neurons. This was able to reproduce enteric ganglionation in a model. Mouse mutants with disturbances of enteric nervous system morphogenesis are discussed, and these suggest future refinement of the models. The modeling suggests a relatively simple set of cell behavioral rules could account for complex patterns of morphogenesis. The model has allowed the proposal that Hirschsprung disease is mostly an enteric neural crest cell proliferation defect, not a defect of cell migration. In addition, the model suggests an explanations for zonal and skip segment variants of Hirschsprung disease, and also gives a novel stochastic explanation for the observed discordancy of Hirschsprung disease in identical twins. © 2013 Elsevier Inc."

In particular, the growth of glioblastoma is investigated on the intracellular and intercellular scale. The Go or Grow principle of tumour cells states that tumour cells either migrate or proliferate. For glioblastoma, microRNA-451 has been shown to be an energy dependent key regulator of the LKB1 (liver kinase B1) and AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) pathway that influences the signalling for migration or cell division. We introduce a mathematical model that reproduces these biological processes. The intracellular molecular interaction network is represented by a system of nine ordinary differential equations. This is put into a multiscale context by applying an agent-based approach: each cell is equipped with this interaction network and additional rules to determine its new phenotype as either migrating, proliferating or quiescent. The evaluation of the proposed model by comparison of the results with in vitro experiments indicates its validity. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

We investigate the effect of spatial interactions in the opposite case, where populations can persist in well-mixed systems. A stochastic agent-based model of host-pathogen dynamics is considered that describes nearest-neighbor interactions in an undivided habitat. Contrary to previous notions, we find that in this setting, spatial interactions in fact promote extinction. The reason is that, in contrast to the mass-action system, the outcome of the nearest-neighbor model is governed by dynamics in small ""local neighbor-hoods."" This is an abstraction that describes interactions in a minimal grid consisting of an individual plus its nearest neighbors. The small size of this characteristic scale accounts for the higher extinction probabilities. Hence, nearest-neighbor interactions in a continuous habitat lead to outcomes reminiscent of a fragmented habitat, which is underlined further with a metapopulation model that explicitly assumes habitat fragmentation. Beyond host-pathogen dynamics, axiomatic modeling shows that our results hold for generic enemy-victim interactions under specified assumptions. These results are used to interpret a set of published experiments that provide a first step toward model testing and are discussed in the context of the literature. © 2013 by The University of Chicago."

These cells adopt a mesenchymal shape and migrate into the basal lamina. Such transitions have been observed in developmental processes and have been linked to cancer cell metastasis. Most experimental studies on EMT search for molecular markers indicating an epithelial or mesenchymal conformation, focussing on afferent signaling pathways received by cells undergoing this transformation; however, these approaches are unable to track mechanical changes in the cell and the possible role this plays in EMT. In order to address this gap in our understanding, we have used a quantitative approach to study population level effects of single cell changes typically occurring during EMT. We have developed a computational model making use of the advantages of both single cell migratory models and agent-based cell population models to study the effect of cellular molecular processes in EMT. The disruption of a cell sheet representing the epithelium over a dense extracellular matrix (ECM) is simulated using interaction forces between different cells and between cells and discrete fibers representing the ECM. In our study, two different parameters were varied: protrusion force magnitude and E-cadherin (cell-cell junction) concentration. The cell population was tracked for 3 days and the number of cells that leave the layer, the depth of invasion, and the percentage of initial number of cells that remain in the layer (a measure of epithelium disruption) were monitored. Our studies suggest that having a high protrusion force or a reduction in cell-cell attachments is enough to cause EMT. Our results also demonstrate that the morphological progression in membrane disruption has an effect on the number of cells becoming invasive, with epithelial layers broken into clusters hindering the further exodus of cells. The results reveal the quantitative interplay between two key parameters involved in EMT and suggest potential avenues for further exploration of a systems level understanding of EMT. © 2013 S.

Urban areas face both a changing urban population size and increasing sustainability issues in terms of providing good socioeconomic and environmental living conditions. Urban planning has to deal with both challenges. Households play a major role by being affected by urban planning decisions on the one hand and by being responsible - among many other factors - for the environmental performance of a city (e.g. energy use). We here present an agent-based decision model referring to the city of Vienna, the capital of Austria, with a population of about 1.7 million (2.3 million within the metropolitan area, the latter being more than 25% of Austria's total population). Since the early 1990s, after decades of negative population growth, Vienna has been experiencing a steady increase in population, mainly driven by immigration. The aim of the agent-based decision model is to simulate new residential patterns of different household types based on demographic development and migration scenarios. Model results were used to assess spatial patterns of energy use caused by different household types in the four scenarios (1) conventional urban planning, (2) sustainable urban planning, (3) expensive centre and (4) no green area preference. Outcomes show that changes in preferences of households relating to the presence of nearby green areas have the most important impact on the distribution of households across the small-scaled city area. Additionally, the results demonstrate the importance of the distribution of different household types regarding spatial patterns of energy use. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd."

Implementing an adequate level of agent heterogeneity and mapping it into a spatial environment are critical factors of such applied modelling. However, policy applications demand the characterisation and parameterisation of behavioural response functions of heterogeneous agents and the spatial distribution of heterogeneous agents, which are neither highly transparent nor greatly tested steps in implementing agent-based models. This paper describes an agent-based model of fuel price changes for a case study in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, and specifically: (a) the characterisation and parameterisation approach, (b) resulting agent types for approximating behavioural heterogeneity, and (c) emerging spatial poverty and deforestation patterns. The model highlights the spatial dynamics of poverty dynamics, indicating that the direct impact of deforestation on poverty among forest-dwelling communities is to trigger their migration into peri-urban areas. Overall, the model suggests that poverty increases in response to fuel price reductions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd."

However, what is unclear is how cell contact dynamics and the distinct microenvironments through which cells travel influence the selection of one migratory mode or the other. The embryonic and highly invasive neural crest (NC) are an excellent model system to study this question since NC cells have been observed in vivo to display both of these types of cell motility. Here, we present data from tissue transplantation experiments in chick and in silico modeling that test our hypothesis that cell contact dynamics with each other and the microenvironment promote and sustain either multicellular stream or chain migration. We show that when premigratory cranial NC cells (at the pre-otic level) are transplanted into a more caudal region in the head (at the post-otic level), cells alter their characteristic stream behavior and migrate in chains. Similarly, post-otic NC cells migrate in streams after transplantation into the pre-otic hindbrain, suggesting that local microenvironmental signals dictate the mode of NC cell migration. Simulations of an agent-based model (ABM) that integrates the NC cell behavioral data predict that chain migration critically depends on the interplay of biased cell-cell contact and local microenvironment signals. Together, this integrated modeling and experimental approach suggests new experiments and offers a powerful tool to examine mechanisms that underlie complex cell migration patterns. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd."

The selection forces are dynamic and depend on many factors. The cells favored by selection are said to be more ""fit"" than others. They tend to leave more viable offspring and spread through the population. What cellular characteristics make certain cells more fit than others? What combinations of the mutant characteristics and "" background"" characteristics make the mutant cells win the evolutionary competition? In this review we concentrate on two phenotypic characteristics of cells: their reproductive potential and their motility. We show that migration has a direct positive impact on the ability of a single mutant cell to invade a pre-existing colony. Thus, a decrease in the reproductive potential can be compensated by an increase in cell migration. We further demonstrate that the neutral ridges (the set of all types with the invasion probability equal to that of the host cells) remain invariant under the increase of system size (for large system sizes), thus making the invasion probability a universal characteristic of the cells' selection status. We list very general conditions under which the optimal phenotype is just one single strategy (thus leading to a nearly-homogeneous type invading the colony), or a large set of strategies that differ by their reproductive potentials and migration characteristics, but have a nearly-equal fitness. In the latter case the evolutionary competition will result in a highly heterogeneous population."

Unfortunately, the majority of the currently available platforms for agents, particularly those based on the standard Java Virtual Machine, do not provide this important feature at the system-level. Several system-level and application-level approaches have been to date proposed for agent state execution capture. Although system-level approaches are effective, they modify the underlying virtual machine so endangering compatibility. Conversely, application-level approaches do not modify any system layer but they provide sophisticated agent programming models and/or agent converters that only allow a coarse-grain capture of agent state execution. In this paper, we propose an application-level technique that allows for a programmable-grain capture of the execution state of agents ranging from a per-instruction to a statement-driven state capture. The technique is based on the Distilled StateCharts Star (DSC*) formalism that offers an agent-oriented type of recursive hierarchical state machines. According to the proposed technique a single-threaded agent program can be translated into a DSC* machine, containing agent data, code and execution state, by preserving the original agent program semantics. The proposed technique can notably be applied to any agent program written through an imperative-style, procedural or object-oriented programming language. Currently, it is implemented in Java and fully integrated into the JADE framework, being JADE one of the most diffused agent platforms. In particular, agents, which are specified through a generic Java-like agent language, can be automatically translated into JADE agents according to the JADE DSCStarBehaviour framework by means of a translator tool. A simple yet effective running example is used to exemplify the proposed technique from modeling to implementation. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Experimental studies are often performed to investigate the role of scaffold architecture on vascularized tissue formation. However, experiments are expensive and time-consuming and synthesis protocols often do not allow for independent investigation of specific scaffold properties. Computational models allow for rapid screening of potential material designs with control over scaffold properties that is difficult in laboratory settings. We have developed and tested a three-dimensional agent-based framework for investigating the effect of scaffold pore architecture on angiogenesis. Software agents represent endothelial cells, interacting together and with their micro-environment, leading to the invasion of blood vessels into the scaffold. A rule base, driven by experimental findings, governs the behavior of individual agents. 3D scaffold models with well-defined homogeneous and heterogeneous pore architectures were simulated to investigate the impact of various design parameters. Simulation results indicate that pores of larger size with higher interconnectivity and porosity support rapid and extensive angiogenesis. The developed framework can be used to screen biomaterial scaffold designs for optimal vascularization and investigate complex interactions among invading blood vessels and their micro-environment. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

Investigators have applied various computational approaches to understand the impact the internal dynamics of such devices has on overall cell growth, but such models cannot provide a comprehensive perspective regarding the system dynamics, due to limitations inherent to the underlying approaches. In this study, a novel multi-paradigm modeling platform capable of simulating the dynamic bidirectional relationship between cells and their microenvironment is presented. Designing the modeling platform entailed combining and coupling fully an agent-based modeling platform with a transport phenomena computational modeling framework. To demonstrate capability, the platform was used to study the impact of bioreactor parameters on the overall cell population behavior and vice versa. In order to achieve this, virtual bioreactors were constructed and seeded. The virtual cells, guided by a set of rules involving the simulated mass transport inside the bioreactor, as well as cell-related probabilistic parameters, were capable of displaying an array of behaviors such as proliferation, migration, chemotaxis and apoptosis. In this way the platform was shown to capture not only the impact of bioreactor transport processes on cellular behavior but also the influence that cellular activity wields on that very same local mass transport, thereby influencing overall cell growth. The platform was validated by simulating cellular chemotaxis in a virtual direct visualization chamber and comparing the simulation with its experimental analogue. The results presented in this paper are in agreement with published models of similar flavor. The modeling platform can be used as a concept selection tool to optimize bioreactor design specifications. © 2013 Kaul et al."

Two explanations have been proposed for this result: The first is that the troop surge worked by increasing counterinsurgent capacity, whereas the second argument is that ethnic unmixing and the establishment of relatively homogenous enclaves were responsible for declining violence in Baghdad through reducing contact. We address this question using an agent-based model that is built on GIS-coded data on violence and ethnic composition in Baghdad. While we cannot fully resolve the debate about the effectiveness of the surge, our model shows that patterns of violence and segregation in Baghdad are consistent with a simple mechanism of ethnically motivated attacks and subsequent migration. Our modeling exercise also informs current debates about the effectiveness of counterinsurgency operations. We implement a simple policing mechanism in our model and show that even small levels of policing can dramatically mitigate subsequent levels of violence. However, our results also show that the timing of these efforts is crucial; early responses to ethnic violence are highly effective, but quickly lose impact as their implementation is delayed. © 2013 International Studies Association."

Recent investigations have established that with just 1 mutation current avian influenza viral strains gain the ability to be readily transmitted between humans. These investigations further motivate the need for detailed analysis, in addition to satellite surveillance, of migratory patterns and its influence on the ecology of the disease to aid design and assessment of prophylaxis and containment strategies for emergent epidemics. Accordingly, this paper proposes a novel methodology for generating a global agent-based stochastic epidemiological model involving detailed migratory patterns of waterfowl. The methodology transforms Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data containing global distribution of various species of waterfowl to generate metapopulation for agents that model collocated flocks of birds. Generic migratory flyways are suitably adapted to model migratory ffyways for each waterfowl metapopulation. Migratory characteristics of various species are used to determine temporal attributes for the flyways. The resulting data is generated in XML format compatible with our simulation-based epidemiological analysis environment called SEARUMS. Case studies conducted using SEARUMS and the generated models for high-risk waterfowl species indicate good correlation between simulated and observed viral dispersion patterns, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methodology."

At the beginning of the simulation, long fibers were randomly distributed and cross linked. Throughout the simulation, imposed rules allowed cells to exert traction forces by extending pseudopodia, binding to fibers and pulling them towards the cell. Simulated cells remodeled the fibrous matrix to change both the density and alignment of fibers and migrated within the matrix in ways that are consistent with previous experimental work. For example, cells compacted the matrix in their pericellular regions much more than the average compaction experienced for the entire matrix (696% versus 21%). Between pairs of cells, the matrix density increased (by 92%) and the fibers became more aligned (anisotropy index increased from 0.45 to 0.68) in the direction parallel to a line connecting the two cells, consistent with the “lines of tension” observed in experiments by others. Cells migrated towards one another at an average rate of ˜0.5 cell diameters per 10, 000 arbitrary units (AU); faster migration occurred in simulations where the fiber density in the intercellular area was greater. To explore the potential contribution of matrix stiffness gradients in the observed migration (i.e., durotaxis), the model was altered to contain a regular lattice of fibers possessing a stiffness gradient and just a single cell. In these simulations cells migrated preferentially in the direction of increasing stiffness at a rate of ˜2 cell diameter per 10, 000 AU. This work demonstrates that matrix remodeling and durotaxis, both complex phenomena, might be emergent behaviors based on just a few rules that control how a cell can interact with a fibrous ECM. © 2013 by ASME."

Human activities are threatening this biodiversity, and many endemic populations now face a medium-term risk of extinction. An individual-based model called DemGenTrout was developed to improve the management of these populations. The model was parameterized, optimized and validated with demographic, genetic, and environmental data collected over 7 years on the Lesse River drainage (Belgium). The sensitivity of the model to its parameters was analysed. The model was then used to assess how the demogenetics of a wild trout population might be affected by anthropogenic disturbances. From the sensitivity analysis, we found that modifications in survival and spawning parameters could lead to important changes in the demogenetics of the studied brown trout population. Two parameters were identified as the most influential in the DemGenTrout model, the survival rate of fry in the brook, and the mean of the spawner condition factor distribution. Two scenarios were simulated over 35 years and compared: (i) a barrier to upstream spawning migration, (ii) stocking with hatchery-reared trout during a 10-year period. Both of them appeared to have a strong short-term impact on the demogenetic structure of the wild trout population. The migration barrier mostly impacted abundance, while genetic issues arose when a significant number of stocked fish survived in the wild. Stocking also appeared to act on a longer time frame if hatchery and wild trout had similar survival and spawning probabilities. © 2012 Elsevier B.V."

Agent-based modeling is used to capture the idea of 'linked lives' and thus to represent hypotheses that are impossible to express in alternative formalisms. Simulation runs suggest that the per-taxpayer cost of state-funded social care could double over the next forty years.

In agent-based micro-simulations, gravity models can be directly used to represent movement of individuals and hence disease. In this paper, we consider a range of gravity models as fits to movement data from the UK and the US. We examine the ability of synthetic networks generated from fitted models to match those from the data in terms of epidemic behaviour; in particular, times to first infection. For both datasets, best fits are obtained with a two-piece 'matched' power law distance distribution. Epidemics on synthetic UK networks match well those on data networks across all but the smallest nodes for a range of aggregation levels. We derive an expression for time to infection between nodes in terms of epidemiological and network parameters which illuminates the influence of network clustering in spread across networks and suggests an approximate relationship between the log-likelihood deviance of model fit and the match times to infection between synthetic and data networks. On synthetic US networks, the match in epidemic behaviour is initially poor and sensitive to the initially infected node. Analysis of times to infection indicates a failure of models to capture infrequent long-range contact between large nodes. An assortative model based on node population size captures this heterogeneity, considerably improving the epidemiological match between synthetic and data networks. © 2012 Truscott, Ferguson."

We have previously established an agent-based modeling framework for the interactions between T cells and dendritic cells within the paracortex of lymph nodes. This model simulates in three dimensions the ""random-walk"" T cell motility observed in vivo, so that cells interact in space and time as they process signals and commit to action such as proliferation. On-lattice treatment of cell motility allows large numbers of densely packed cells to be simulated, so that the low frequency of T cells capable of responding to a single antigen can be dealt with realistically. In this paper we build on this model by incorporating new numerical methods to address the crucial processes of T cell ingress and egress, and chemotaxis, within the lymph node. These methods enable simulation of the dramatic expansion and contraction of the T cell population in the lymph node paracortex during an immune response. They also provide a novel probabilistic method to simulate chemotaxis that will be generally useful in simulating other biological processes in which chemotaxis is an important feature. © 2012 Bogle, Dunbar."

We have recently shown that the level of infarct anisotropy is a critical determinant of heart function following a large anterior infarction, which suggests that therapeutic gains may be realized by controlling infarct anisotropy. However, factors regulating infarct anisotropy are not well understood. Mechanical, structural and chemical guidance cues have all been shown to regulate alignment of fibroblasts and collagen in vitro, and prior studies have proposed that each of these cues could regulate anisotropy of infarct scar tissue, but understanding of fibroblast behaviour in the complex environment of a healing infarct is lacking. We developed an agent-based model of infarct healing that accounted for the combined influence of these cues on fibroblast alignment, collagen deposition and collagen remodelling. We pooled published experimental data from several sources in order to determine parameter values, then used the model to test the importance of each cue for predicting collagen alignment measurements from a set of recent cryoinfarction experiments. We found that although chemokine gradients and pre-existing matrix structures had important effects on collagen organization, a response of fibroblasts to mechanical cues was critical for correctly predicting collagen alignment in infarct scar. Many proposed therapies for myocardial infarction, such as injection of cells or polymers, alter the mechanics of the infarct region. Our modelling results suggest that such therapies could change the anisotropy of the healing infarct, which could have important functional consequences. This model is therefore a potentially important tool for predicting how such interventions change healing outcomes. © 2012 The Physiological Society."

Understanding how interactions between these factors influence the risk of transmission could improve the effectiveness of the allocation of vector control resources. To evaluate the combined impacts of variation in A. aegypti production and human density we integrated field data with simulation modeling. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using data from seven censuses of A. aegypti pupae (2007-2009) and from demographic surveys, we developed an agent-based transmission model of the dengue transmission cycle across houses in 16 dengue-endemic urban 'patches' (1-3 city blocks each) of Armenia, Colombia. Our field data showed that 92% of pupae concentrated in only 5% of houses, defined as super-producers. Average secondary infections (R0) depended on infrequent, but highly explosive transmission events. These super-spreading events occurred almost exclusively when the introduced infectious person infected mosquitoes that were produced in super-productive containers. Increased human density favored R0, and when the likelihood of human introduction of virus was incorporated into risk, a strong interaction arose between vector production and human density. Simulated intervention of super-productive containers was substantially more effective in reducing dengue risk at higher human densities. Significance/Conclusions: These results show significant interactions between human population density and the natural regulatory pattern of A. aegypti in the dynamics of dengue transmission. The large epidemiological significance of super-productive containers suggests that they have the potential to influence dengue viral adaptation to mosquitoes. Human population density plays a major role in dengue transmission, due to its potential impact on human-A. aegypti contact, both within a person's home and when visiting others. The large variation in population density within typical dengue endemic cities suggests that it should be a major consideration in dengue control policy. © 2012 Padmanabha et al."

Although cell-cell contact and extracellular matrix (ECM) cues have been proposed to promote this phenomenon, mechanisms that underlie chain migration persistence remain unclear. Here, we developed a quantitative agent-based modelling framework to test mechanistic hypotheses of chain migration persistence. We defined chain migration and its persistence based on evidence from the highly migratory neural crest model system, where cells within a chain extend and retract filopodia in short-lived cell contacts and move together as a collective. In our agent-based simulations, we began with a set of agents arranged as a chain and systematically probed the influence of model parameters to identify factors critical to the maintenance of the chain migration pattern. We discovered that chain migration persistence requires a high degree of directional bias in both lead and follower cells towards the target. Chain migration persistence was also promoted when lead cells maintained cell contact with followers, but not vice-versa. Finally, providing a path of least resistance in the ECM was not sufficient alone to drive chain persistence. Our results indicate that chain migration persistence depends on the interplay of directional cell movement and biased cell-cell contact. © 2012 The Royal Society."

Numerous complex processes potentially influence the transport of spermatozoa within the tract, resulting in a regulated supply of spermatozoa to the oocytes at the site of fertilization. Despite significant differences between species, breeds, and individuals, these processes converge to ensure that a sufficient number of high quality spermatozoa reach the oocytes, resulting in successful fertilization without a significant risk of polyspermy. Different factors, such as the physical complexity of the oviductal environment, changing swimming patterns, capacitation, chemotactic and thermotactic attraction, attachment and detachment from the oviductal epithelium, interactions with local oviductal secretions, individual variations in spermatozoa and subpopulations, peristaltic contractions, and the movement of fluid have all been theorized to influence the transport of spermatozoa to the site of fertilization. However, the predominance of each factor is not fully understood. Computational modeling provides a useful method for combining knowledge about the individual processes in complex systems to help understand the relative significance of each factor. The process of constructing and validating an agent-based computational model of sperm movement and transport within the oviductal environment is described in this report. Spermatozoa are modeled as individual cells with a set of behavioral rules defining how they interact with their local environment and regulate their internal state. The inclusion or potential exclusion of each factor is discussed, along with problems identifying parameters and defining behavioral rules from available literature.

Besides using a multinomial logit choice model that allows for agent idiosyncrasy, explicit agent heterogeneity is introduced in the form of socio-demographic characteristics preferred by modern-sector employers. We find that different combinations of the strength of social influence and the socio-economic composition of the workforce lead to very different urbanization and urban informal sector shares. In particular, moderate levels of social influence and a large proportion of rural inhabitants with preferred socio-demographic characteristics are conducive to a higher urbanization rate and a larger informal sector. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, the dynamic shifts underway affecting consumer behaviors will likely limit the value of the current approaches to the near term insights. We propose that a longer view requires a method of analysis and assessment more appropriate to the plausible variations in economic, energy, population, and other dynamics that affect future transportation consumption. We present the case for and the summary of our implementation of such a method in this paper. The inputs to our analysis are developed in the context of a set of global external drivers, four independent drivers in our case, each of which can exhibit more (or higher) or less (or lower) influences affecting parameters that in turn affect transportation demand (such as GDP, energy prices, population dynamics, etc.). Further, because we cannot predict particular futures, we also need a means of establishing groups (or plausible ""worlds"") of parameter settings that respond to combinations of global drivers. In the context of the four drivers, the study team established combinations of dependent parameters, five sets of parameters (or five plausible ""worlds"") in our case, in the context of the combinations of levels of influence of the drivers. The outputs of the analysis will include demand for all modes of transportation (air, ground, and virtual), quantity of demand that can be satisfied through new or existing aircraft and business models, environmental impact considerations, the longer-term coevolutionary effects of migration (for example) on locations of demand and supply. We observe that our approach overcomes some limitations of current approaches for understanding transportation demand and satisfaction in the farther term. The implementation of our method employs agent-based (ABM) demand and supply modeling, coupled with airspace modeling tools used for airspace capacity analyses under various NextGen airspace operating concepts. The process generates demand for mobility by all modes, using transportation gravity laws, tailored for leisure and business travel separately. The modes include scheduled air carriers, highway driving, on-demand electric aircraft, virtual (telepresence), rail, and bus. Then we test that demand against constraints associated with system capacities, fleet vehicle size considerations, and environment (noise and emissions), for each of the five ""worlds."" With the process, we can evaluate strategic thinking for options beyond the current NextGen implementation plans, as well as for technology strategies beyond those currently in place in the Federal research sector.

Global climate change adds to the gravity of these effects. The survival of wildlife species is subjected to enormous pressure due to natural environmental changes and human activities. Agent-based models (ABMs) are computer simulation models analyzing and simulating human or animal behavior through the integration of learning, adaptation, evolution and logical analysis. ABMs study the overall system characteristics by analyzing internal elements of the system (such as the interaction among individual agents, and agents with the environment) with a bottom-up approach. The agents in ABMs can complete given objectives, perceive and respond to changes of the external environment through the default logic control, and respond to stimuli from other agents and the external environment through learning and adaptation functions. This paper designed an agent-based evaluation model of an ecological pattern, which was used to analyze the impact of different woodland patterns on species survival and dispersal. The model focused on the logic control of survival and dispersal of agents, and used the dispersal strategy integrating CRW and LW models, which combines the advantages of these two models. The survival of the agent is control by the age-specified U-shaped survival curve and determination function considering their own energy and environmental risks. The model was developed on the GIS platform, realizing the seamless integration of the agent model and GIS, which could then be applied to real geographical environment simulation. Qingdao is a city located in the eastern coastal region of China where the economy is relatively well-developed. The region is also where marine and terrestrial ecosystems meet. Woodland is mainly distributed in the Laoshan Mountains in the east, the Daze Mountains in the north, and the Dazhu, Xiaozhu and Tiejue Mountains in the south. In the study area, the ecological environment is deteriorating, and various wildlife species are being impacted, with some species being endangered or facing extinction. This paper selected the woodlands in the Qingdao district as the study object, analyzing the effect of different spatial patterns on the survival and spread of woodland species. Simulation results showed that, compared with the original state, species populations and migration have improved significantly under different levels of ecological network framework, and the higher the level of ecological network framework, the more obvious the improvement. The distance between patches had a large influence on the dispersal of simulated species because they were not able to arrive at patches that were far away from the original patch. Therefore, this paper makes the suggestion that an approach integrating wetland and woodland systems could strengthen woodland system functional contact in the study area. It is suggested that the region around Jiaozhou Bay and the mainstream of Dagu River be used to increase the spatial distribution of woodland. Based on the simulation results, suggestions for the woodland ecological pattern construction are given below: (1) ensure that the large woodland can not be destroyed; (2) the wetland system district in the middle of Qingdao is an ideal place for a new woodland construction; (3) the ecological network framework can be used as a spatial reference for an ecological barrier to prevent the spread of urban land into woodland."

Agents sense signals from the damaged environment and produce effector molecules, leading to their healing behavior. The In Vitro Scratch Agent-Based Model qualitatively matched wound healing dynamics when compared against data from traditional experiments. Putative cross-talk mechanisms were then instantiated into the In Vitro Scratch Agent-Based Model and their relative plausibility examined, suggesting interaction at the receptor tyrosine kinase level. This highlights the utility of dynamic knowledge representation in the integration of pathways previously studied in separate contexts. © 2012 by the Wound Healing Society."

At the intracellular level, the MABM approach employs a system of ordinary differential equations to describe quantitatively specific intracellular molecular pathways that determine phenotypic switches among cells (e.g. from migration to proliferation and vice versa). At the intercellular level, MABM describes cell-cell interactions by a discrete module. At the tissue level, partial differential equations are employed to model the diffusion of chemoattractants, which are the input factors of the intracellular molecular pathway. Moreover, multiscale analysis makes it possible to explore the molecules that play important roles in determining the cellular phenotypic switches that in turn drive the whole GBM expansion. However, owing to limited computational resources, MABM is currently a theoretical biological model that uses relatively coarse grids to simulate a few cancer cells in a small slice of brain cancer tissue. In order to improve this theoretical model to simulate and predict actual GBM cancer progression in real time, a graphics processing unit (GPU)-based parallel computing algorithm was developed and combined with the multi-resolution design to speed up the MABM. The simulated results demonstrated that the GPU-based, multi-resolution and multiscale approach can accelerate the previous MABM around 30-fold with relatively fine grids in a large extracellular matrix. Therefore, the new model has great potential for simulating and predicting real-time GBM progression, if real experimental data are incorporated. © 2011 Zhang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

Overhyped and underdeveloped, early urban models soon proved unreliable. Their epitaph, ""Requiem for Large-Scale Models,"" published in the Journal of the American Institute of Planners (Lee 1973), is still one of the most widely read and cited journal articles in planning. By the early 1990s, UGMs had staged a small-scale comeback, buoyed by new modeling techniques - especially discrete choice models - further improvements in computing speed and storage capacity, the migration of GIS from mainframe to desktop, advances in data distribution channels (first CDs, later the Internet), and by the desire of local governments and MPOs to go beyond linear trend lines to investigate alternative planning scenarios. By 2000, a survey by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had uncovered more than twenty urban forecasting and simulation models, most of which had not existed just ten years earlier (U.S. EPA 2000). Recent and dramatic increases in the availability of high-resolution satellite imagery have given even greater impetus to urban modeling. Recent developments in urban modeling have been chronicled by Batty (1994, 2005) and Wegener (1994, 1998b). For the most part, UGMs have been developed and applied in the Global North, where their data needs can be more easily met. Recent improvements in remote sensing offer potential for their use in the Global South. The allure of UGMs remains as siren-like today as in the 1960s. Foremost, they offer the promise of reducing huge volumes of local data into a few robust and understandable generalizations about processes of urban change. Second, they promise to facilitate thinking about the future of cities in ways that are new, nontraditional, and spatial. Third, with the addition of discrete choice modeling, they offer the ability to link the decisions and behaviors of individual agents to metropolitan outcomes; and this, more than any other capability, is the key to planning for sustainability. Fourth and most important, they provide a key analytical bridge between envisioning alternative urban development patterns and evaluating their impacts. Promise and performance, however, don't always go hand in hand. Fifteen years after their resurrection, questions about UGMs still remain. Are they facilitating better metropolitan investment and policy decisions? Are they leading to a richer, more nuanced, and more comprehensive understanding of the effects of those investment and policy decisions? Are they helping open up local and metropolitan discussions about development to new ideas, approaches, and participants? Are they making the practice of local and metropolitan planning noticeably better? The answer to these questions for the most part is ""no"": UGMs are still too complicated, still too untested, and still too slow to adapt to local circumstances to be used regularly and reliably. Nonetheless, progress continues, and the state of the art of urban modeling advances daily. This chapter takes a hopeful but critical look at UGMs through the lens of four archetypes: (1) the IRPUD (Institute for Regional Planning and Urban Development) model developed at the University of Dortmund, the best heir to the spatial interaction models of the 1960s; (2) the SLEUTH (Slope, Land Use, Exclusion, Urban extent, Transportation, Hillshade) model, an example of the use of cellular automata (CA) procedures to model urban change; (3) the California Urban Futures (CUF) family of urban growth models, the first to employ GIS; and (4) UrbanSim, the leading example of agent-based urban modeling.1 All four share two essential characteristics: they are calibrated, which means their coefficients are estimated from historical experience and are therefore not ad hoc; and they are spatially explicit, capable of looking at urban change at the level of an individual parcel (or comparably sized grid cell). This chapter is organized in four sections. The first, ""Why Urban Growth Models?"" explains UGM functions. The second, ""Four Archetypal Urban Growth Models,"" introduces the four selected UGMs. The third, ""Model Comparisons,"" looks at their respective structures, calibration procedures, ease of data assembly, and usefulness for simulation. The fourth, ""A UGM Research and Development Agenda,"" offers ideas for future modeling developments and application efforts and reflects on the future uses of UGMs worldwide.

These studies generally make simplistic assumptions about the response of an individual to variations in climate. However, empirical evidence of environmentally induced migration does not support such a structural approach and recognises that migration decisions are usually both multi-causal and shaped through individual agency. As such, agent-based modelling offers a robust method to simulate the autonomous decision making process relating to environmental migration. The Theory of Planned Behaviour provides a basis that can be used to effectively break down the reasoning process relating to the development of a behavioural intention. By developing an agent-based model of environmental migration for Burkina Faso from the basis of a combination of such theoretical developments and data analysis we further investigate the role of the environment in the decision to migrate using scenarios of future demographic, economic, social, political, and climate change in a dryland context. We find that in terms of climate change, it can be seen that that change to a drier environment produces the largest total and international migration fluxes when combined with changes to inclusive and connected social and political governance. While the lowest international migration flows are produced under a wetter climate with exclusive and diverse governance scenarios. In summary this paper illustrates how agent-based models incorporating the Theory of Planned Behaviour can be used to project evidence based future changes in migration in response to future demographic, economic social and climate change. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd."

This central-peripheral group structure can arise by self-organization as a result of subordinates fleeing from dominants after losing a fight. However, in real primates, subordinates often avoid interactions with potentially aggressive group members, thereby preventing aggression and subsequent fleeing. Using agent-based modeling, we investigated which spatial and encounter structures emerge when subordinates also avoid known potential aggressors at a distance as compared with the model which only included fleeing after losing a fight (fleeing model). A central-peripheral group structure emerged in most conditions. When avoidance was employed at small or intermediate distances, centrality of dominants emerged similar to the fleeing model, but in a more pronounced way. This result was also found when fleeing after a fight was made independent of dominance rank, i.e. occurred randomly. Employing avoidance at larger distances yielded more spread out groups. This provides a possible explanation of larger group spread in more aggressive species. With avoidance at very large distances, spatially and socially distinct subgroups emerged. We also investigated how encounters were distributed amongst group members. In the fleeing model all individuals encountered all group members equally often, whereas in the avoidance model encounters occurred mostly among similar-ranking individuals. Finally, we also identified a very general and simple mechanism causing a central-peripheral group structure: when individuals merely differed in velocity, faster individuals automatically ended up at the periphery. In summary, a central-peripheral group pattern can easily emerge from individual variation in different movement properties in general, such as fleeing, avoidance or velocity. Moreover, avoidance behavior also affects the encounter structure and can lead to subgroup formation. © 2011 Evers et al."

This scenario becomes even worse when the study involves migration and social networks, which often lacks on representative data and consensually accepted concepts by demographers and sociologists. In this paper we propose a new multi-evolutionary agent model dedicated to social simulations, mainly for those problems where higher order dynamic behaviors (e.g. secondary emergent phenomena) are important to the investigated phenomenon. Its usefulness lies on its multilevel evolutionary adaptability which enables it to capture multiple parallel phenomena. To verify our hypothesis we applied the model to Brazilian internal human migration phenomenon and to the influence of social networks on migration flows. This is followed by a comparative analysis against simulations carried out based on a non-evolutionary cognitive agent model. Results show that the proposed model was able to rise secondary migration-related phenomena such as countermigration flows. Experiments with the cognitive agent also produced the emergence of migration flows but no secondary phenomenon was observed which was the case with our approach. Furthermore, results also pointed out a significant influence exerted by information exchange inside social networks on migration flows. © 2011 IEEE."

The models aims at reproducing a distribution of settlements with statistical and spatial characteristics similar to a historically produced pattern. The model operates on a representation of a real territory, taking into account hydrography and relief. The two main goals are to obtain a rank size distribution of the size of settlements which corresponds to a power law (also known as the Zipf Law of settlements) and to place the settlements in the territory in patterns that are close to the real ones, in zones where settlements were the result of a long historical process. The goal of the project was to demonstrate that a set of relatively simple rules could produce a complex pattern, similar to the result of a long and complex historical process. Therefore, it is an assumed reductionist approach. Our conclusions show that a simple territorial logic, taking into account the quality of land, accessibility, population growth and migration preferences could reproduce Zipf distributions and interesting patterns of agent flow among the settlements created. However, achieving spatial patterns closer to the historical record needs an extra dimension involving field of sight.

The hallmark of infection is the emergence of organized structures of immune cells forming primarily in the lung in response to infection. Granulomas physically contain and immunologically restrain bacteria that cannot be cleared. We have developed several models that spatially characterize the dynamics of the host-mycobacterial interaction, and identified mechanisms that control granuloma formation and development. In particular, we published several agent-based models (ABMs) of granuloma formation in TB that include many subtypes of T cell populations, macrophages as well as key cytokine and chemokine effector molecules. These ABM studies emphasize the important role of T-cell related mechanisms in infection progression, such as magnitude and timing of T cell recruitment, and macrophage activation. In these models, the priming and recruitment of T cells from the lung draining lymph node (LN) was captured phenomenologically. In addition to these ABM studies, we have also developed several multi-organ models using ODEs to examine trafficking of cells between, for example, the lung and LN. While we can predict temporal dynamic behaviors, those models are not coupled to the spatial aspects of granuloma. To this end, we have developed a multi-organ model that is hybrid: an ABM for the lung compartment and a non-linear system of ODE representing the lymph node compartment. This hybrid multi-organ approach to study TB granuloma formation in the lung and immune priming in the LN allows us to dissect protective mechanisms that cannot be achieved using the single compartment or multi-compartment ODE system. The main finding of this work is that trafficking of important cells known as antigen presenting cells from the lung to the lymph node is a key control mechanism for protective immunity: the entire spectrum of infection outcomes can be regulated by key immune cell migration rates. Our hybrid multi-organ implementation suggests that effector CD4+ T cells can rescue the system from a persistent infection and lead to clearance once a granuloma is fully formed. This could be effective as an immunotherapy strategy for latently infected individuals. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd."

A variety of computational models have been developed, each focusing on different aspects of the angiogenesis process and occurring at different biological scales, ranging from the molecular to the tissue levels. Integration of models at different scales is a challenging and currently unsolved problem. Results: We present an object-oriented module-based computational integration strategy to build a multiscale model of angiogenesis that links currently available models. As an example case, we use this approach to integrate modules representing microvascular blood flow, oxygen transport, vascular endothelial growth factor transport and endothelial cell behavior (sensing, migration and proliferation). Modeling methodologies in these modules include algebraic equations, partial differential equations and agent-based models with complex logical rules. We apply this integrated model to simulate exercise-induced angiogenesis in skeletal muscle. The simulation results compare capillary growth patterns between different exercise conditions for a single bout of exercise. Results demonstrate how the computational infrastructure can effectively integrate multiple modules by coordinating their connectivity and data exchange. Model parameterization offers simulation flexibility and a platform for performing sensitivity analysis.

Attempts to quantify the numbers of people affected have commonly been based around calculating the numbers of ‘environmental refugees’ by projecting physical climate changes, such as sea-level rise or rainfall decline, on an exposed population. These studies generally make simplistic assumptions about the ability of individuals to cope with variations in climate. However, empirical evidence of environmentally induced migration have not supported such an approach with the recognition that migration decisions are usually not mono-causal but influenced by multiple factors involving complex spatial interactions under heterogeneous conditions. In this context, agent based modelling offers a robust method to model autonomous decision making in relation to migration. In this chapter we discuss the theoretical development of an agent-based modelling approach to climate change-migration studies using the example of Burkina Faso. In doing so we cover questions of emergence, validation, and bounded rationality related to quantitative migration studies. © 2011, Springer Science+Business Media B.V."

The ABM simulates decision-making processes at the household level that is examined through a longitudinal, socio-economic and demographic survey that was conducted in 1990 and 1999. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are used to establish spatial relationships between farms and their environment, while classified Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery is used to set initial land-use/land-cover conditions for the spatial simulation, assess from-to land-use/land-cover change patterns, and describe trajectories of land use change at the farm and landscape levels. Results from prior studies in the NEA provide insights into the key social and ecological variables, describe human behavioral functions, and examine population-environment interactions that are linked to deforestation and agricultural extensification, population migration, and demographic change. Within the architecture of the model, agents are classified as active or passive. The model comprises four modules, i.e., initialization, demography, agriculture, and migration that operate individually, but are linked through key household processes. The main outputs of the model include a spatially-explicit representation of the land use/land cover on survey and non-survey farms and at the landscape level for each annual time-step, as well as simulated socio-economic and demographic characteristics of households and communities. The work describes the design and implementation of the model and how population-environment interactions can be addressed in a frontier setting. The paper contributes to land change science by examining important pattern-process relations, advocating a spatial modeling approach that is capable of synthesizing fundamental relationships at the farm level, and links people and environment in complex ways. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd."

Housing location decision-making is a complex process involving many features of the housing market that interact with the perceptions of home searchers. Although modellers have paid much attention to the prices and utilities of the environmental, ecological, and public services associated with housing, the housing search process is neglected in many agent-based land use models involving urban housing market. The challenge of incorporating housing search partially lies in the prohibitive cost of identifying, recording, and quantifying housing search activities at a large scale. This paper presents an agent-based model of intraurban migration featuring straightforward yet empirically accurate rules for housing search. Drawing on intervening opportunity and intraurban migration theories, this model is specified and calibrated using real-world housing vacancies and relocation origin-destination pairs extracted from parcel records available in the Twin Cities for 2005 to 2007. Multiple validation methods, including inner migration rates, Syrjala tests, and minimum spanning tree comparisons, show that the search rules based on housing vacancy distribution and negative exponential distance-decay probability can satisfactorily simulate the pattern of the housing search and locational choices made by homeowners in the Twin Cities of Minnesota."

Amenity migration (i.e. movement of people from metropolitan to rural settings) is a major driving force of this transition in many areas. However, the effects of amenity migration on the receiving landscapes are not yet fully understood. Agent-based land use modelling helps unravel the complex spatio-temporal relationships that affect landscape response to change from amenity migration. A land subdivision module is essential for a complete agent-based land use model developed for these landscapes because the land sold to in-migrants are lots that are subdivided from much larger tracts. In this paper we describe a land subdivision automation procedure and its implementation for a rectangular land system. It takes into account the dimensions of the candidate parcel, minimum lot size, and initial street arrangement for both target and neighbouring parcels. Subdivision layouts can be generated either to achieve the maximum number of lots or an optimal balance between number of lots and new streets. This module provides subdivision layouts for all candidate parcels in the land use model. And it potentially serves as an integral component in many other models, as well as a stand alone tool for generating subdivision layouts, complex polygon splitting and studies that attempt to establish relationships between land subdivision and habitat fragmentation."

The proper representation of individual-individual and individual-environment interaction in agent-based simulations of such systems is, therefore, of paramount importance to model design. In this article we develop and implement a context-driven, agent-based modeling approach that supports the explicit representation of situation-dependent information for decision making within dynamic spatial environments. This context-driven approach is characterized by the identification of primitive contextual elements, the organization of such elements into context patterns, and contextualized learning. We synthesize two existing frameworks for the representation of spatiotemporal context and extend them to include higher level constructs and feedback mechanisms needed for learning and adaptation. Contextualized information is organized, analyzed, and used by agents to enhance their problem-solving capabilities. Dynamically changing information relevant to the decision-making processes of agents is captured in this approach and used to drive spatiotemporal learning in agents. We examine the utility of this context-driven approach via an agent-based model of elk movement. Elk in this model are represented as contextually aware intelligent agents that learn optimal movement patterns and adapt to heterogeneous landscape dynamics. The internal and external stimuli received by elk during migration are incorporated into the representation of agent context. The context-driven approach, as experimental results indicate, provides solid support for the representation of individual-centric interactions within complex adaptive spatial systems. © 2010 by Association of American Geographers."

These studies identified critical factors influencing epidemic spread, but they also left important questions unanswered. The objective of this project was to design a more realistic agent-based model that would overcome limitations of earlier models and provide new insights into these outstanding questions. Methods: The new model extends the previous agent-based model to three communities so that results can be compared to those from the population-based model. Sensitivity testing was conducted, and the new model was used to investigate the influence of seasonal settlement and mobility patterns, the geographic heterogeneity of the observed 1918-1919 epidemic in Manitoba, and other questions addressed previously. Results: Results confirm outcomes from the population-based model that suggest that (a) social organization and mobility strongly influence the timing and severity of epidemics and (b) the impact of the epidemic would have been greater if it had arrived in the summer rather than the winter. New insights from the model suggest that the observed heterogeneity among communities in epidemic impact was not unusual and would have been the expected outcome given settlement structure and levels of interaction among communities. Conclusions: Application of an agent-based computer simulation has helped to better explain observed patterns of spread of the 1918-1919 flu epidemic in central Manitoba.

Complexity arises from interconnections between multiple and intertwined processes, affected by harsh climatic and soil conditions, cropping practices and labor migrations. Having faced a spatially heterogeneous and dynamic environment for centuries, local rice farmers are very adaptive and are used to adjusting their behavior in unpredictable climatic and economic conditions. Better understanding is needed to manage the key interactions between labor, land and water use for rice production, especially when major investments in new water infrastructure are now being considered. Based on the principles of the iterative and evolving Companion Modeling (ComMod) approach, indigenous and academic knowledge was integrated in an Agent-Based Model (ABM) co-designed with farmers engaged in different types of farming practices over a period of three years to create a shared representation of the complex and adaptive social-agroecological system in Ban Mak Mai village, in the south of Ubon Ratchathani province. The ABM consists of three interacting modules: Water (hydro-climatic processes), Rice, and Household. ""Household"" is a rule-based agent; it makes daily decisions based on its available means of production, taking into account the stage of the rice crop, and water and labor availability. Key decisions made are related to: i) rice nursery establishment, ii) rice transplanting, iii) rice harvesting, and iv) migration of household members. The spatially explicit model interface represents a virtual rainfed lowland rice environment as an archetypical toposequence made of upper to lower paddies in a mini-catchment farmed by 4 different households, and also includes water bodies and human settlements. Thanks to intensive communication, the participating farmers, made sure that the ABM adequately represents their rice farming and labor migration management practices. They found the model useful to deepen their understanding of the interrelations between labor migrations and rice production, which helped to strengthen their adaptive management ability. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd."

Discussions among urban planners and policymakers in Europe have focused on the consequences of urban shrinkage following demographic transition, fertility decline and individualization. In this study, the shrinking city of Leipzig in Eastern Germany is singled out as a case basis for the study of residential mobility and land use change using agent-based modeling techniques, in which social scientists developed a concept of household types based on empirical data that form a unique base; these techniques were used to construct a data-driven, agent-based model. The spatially explicit simulation model RESMOB. city presented here 'translates' these empirical data via behavioral rules of households. It computes spatially explicit household patterns, housing demands and residential vacancies. Based on three scenarios, population growth, stagnation and shrinkage, we show that population might stabilize within the coming years. The number of households is expected to further increase. We demonstrate that a selective demolition of vacant housing stock can counteract the enormous oversupply of dwellings and better balance housing demand and the number of available flats. Scenario simulation shows that the model can reproduce observed patterns of population, inner-urban migration and residential vacancy in a spatially explicit manner and thus can be applied to the analysis of scenarios of demographic change in urban regions.

Invasive cluster formation has been assumed to be dependent on directed migration and a heterogeneous environment - a conclusion derived from complex models of tumor-environment interaction. At the same time, these models have not included the prospect, now supported by a preponderance of evidence, that only a minority of cancer cells may have stem cell capacity. This proves to weigh heavily on the microenvironmental requirements for the display of characteristic tumor growth phenotypes. We show using agent-based modeling that some defining features of tumor growth ascribed to directed migration might also be realized under random migration, and discuss broader implications for cause-and-effect determination in general.Results: Considering only the properties of random migration in tumors composed of stem cells and committed cells, we are able to recapitulate a characteristic clustering feature of invasive tumor growth, a property we attribute to ""self-metastatic"" growth. When the additional influence of directed migrations under chemotactic environments are considered, we find that tumor growth and invasive morphology are supported while the tumor is distant from the source, but are progressively discouraged as the tumor converges about that source.Conclusions: We show that invasive clustering can derive from basic kinetic assumptions often neglected in more complex models. While higher-order mechanisms, e.g. directed migration upon chemotactic stimuli, may result in clustering growth morphologies, exclusive attributions of this phenotype to this or other structured microenvironments would be inappropriate, in light of our finding these features are observable in a homogeneous environment. Furthermore, directed migration will result in loss of the invasive phenotype as the tumor approaches the attractor source.

These interactions can be mediated remotely by diffusive biochemical factors, or by direct cell-cell contact. E-cadherin is a protein expressed on the surface of normal epithelial cells that plays a key role in mediating intercellular adhesion via calcium-dependent homotypic interactions. E-cadherin is a metastasis-suppressor protein and its loss of function is associated with malignant progression. The purpose of this study was to apply an agent-based simulation paradigm in order to examine the emergent growth properties of mixed populations consisting of normal and E-cadherin defective cells in monolayer cell culture. Specifically, we have investigated the dynamics of normal cell:cell interactions in terms of intercellular adhesion and migration, and have used a simplified rule to represent the concepts of juxtacrine epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation and subsequent effect on cell proliferation. This cellular level control determines the overall population growth in a simulated experiment. Our approach provides a tool for modelling the development of defined biological abnormalities in epithelial and other biological tissues, raising novel predictions for future experimental testing. The results predict that even a relatively small number of abnormal ('anti-social') cells can modify the rate of the total population expansion, but the magnitude of this effect also depends on the extrinsic (culture) environment. In addition to directly influencing population dynamics, 'anti-social' cells can also disrupt the behaviour of the normal cells around them. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Modeling T-cell responses in lymph nodes now requires integration of cell trafficking and motility with the molecular processes involved in T-cell activation. We describe an agent-based model that allows such integration, in which T cells undertake a random walk through a three-dimensional representation of the lymph node paracortex, integrating signals from dendritic cells (DCs), and proliferating in response. The model accommodates simulation of a large number of T cells packed at realistic densities, and includes dynamic cell trafficking that allows the lymph nodes to swell and shrink as the immune response progresses. The results from the model, including the kinetics of cognate T-cell proliferation and release, and the changes in their avidity profile, are similar to those observed in vivo. We therefore propose that this modeling framework is capable of successfully simulating T-cell activation while also accounting for new spatiotemporal knowledge of how T cells and DCs interact. Although some of the parameters used to drive the model are not yet experimentally validated, the model is capable of testing the effects of alternative values for any parameter on the T-cell response. We intend to refine each aspect of the model in collaboration with both theoreticians and experimentalists. © 2010 Australasian Society for Immunology Inc. All rights reserved."

One of them consists in studying migrations of green sea turtles for mating purpose. As existing mathematical models struggle to take spatial dimension into account, we propose an agent-based model to study some of the numerous questions regarding green sea turtles migrations. Coming with high expectations, experts in sea turtles also provide many heterogeneous but incomplete data. Considering available or obtainable data in one hand and the various questions of experts in the other hand, we defined an innovative modelling process in which we simultaneously conduct discussion with experts and prototyping.

Intensive experiments have suggested that the emergences and dynamics of labor migrations: 1) a region with high tax rate always provides better welfare service, which is an important reason for attracting labors migrations; 2) when the cultural distance is small, labors migrate to the regions with better welfare service, otherwise, 3) when the cultural distance is high, only labors in regions with high tax rate can obtain high welfare and make migrations between regions; 4) although different wage levels have different effects on regions with different tax rates, the main factor which causes labor migrations is to obtain better benefits from the welfare service. © 2010 SICE."

This fieldwork led to build a set of rules for the behaviour of individuals in non-pastoralist villages. We implemented these rules into an agent-based model simulating three village archetypes. Each archetype includes biophysical, economical, social agricultural and livestock modules. Results from simulations with no social transition processes show that villages specialize themselves into different economic activities according to natural resource specificities: A decreasing intensification gradient is observed from the most favoured site, with more local productions and good ecological indicators, to the less-favoured site, with a growing proportion of the population wealth coming from migration remittances and "" off-shore"" livestock. Two family transition processes were implemented, following field observations and literature-based hypotheses: family organizations evolve between a patriarchal mode and a non-cooperative mode following tensions due to income redistribution. Family inheritance systems evolve from a "" customary"" one-heir mode to a "" local Muslim"" mode in which all males inherits land. This evolution depends on family tensions due to land availability. Once introducing these processes, the population of each site differentiates itself into specialized groups according to size, assets and social status. Meanwhile, the group proportions and specializations strongly vary according to the sites but they are all characterized by the emergence of individualistic family types and the increase of the village populations' robustness. © 2010 Elsevier B.V."

Modeling MCBS requires incorporating these complex interactions among the individual cells and the environment. Modeling approaches for MCBS can be grouped into two categories: continuum models and cell-based models. Continuum models usually take the form of partial differential equations, and the model equations provide insight into the relationship among the components in the system. Cell-based models simulate each individual cell behavior and interactions among them enabling the observation of the emergent system behavior. This review focuses on the cell-based models of MCBS, and especially, the technical aspect of the rule-based simulation method for MCBS is reviewed. How to implement the cell behaviors and the interactions with other cells and with the environment into the computational domain is discussed. The cell behaviors reviewed in this paper are division, migration, apoptosis/necrosis, and differentiation.

In this bottom-up simulation approach, a landscape can be created and populated with a heterogeneous group of agents who move and interact in ways that more closely resemble human behavior than is usually seen in other modeling techniques. In this project, an agent-based model was constructed to simulate the spread of the 1918 influenza pandemic through the Norway House community in Manitoba, Canada. Archival, ethnographic, epidemiological, and biological information were used to aid in designing the structure of the model and to estimate values for model parameters. During the epidemic, Norway House was a Hudson's Bay Company post and a Swampy Cree-Métis settlement with an economy based on hunting, fishing, and the fur trade. The community followed a traditional, seasonal travel pattern of summer aggregation and winter dispersal. The model was used to examine how seasonal community structures and associated population movement patterns may have influenced disease transmission and epidemic spread.

Two family transition processes are here tested, following field observations and literature-based hypotheses: family organizations can evolve between a patriarchal mode and a non-cooperative one because of family income redistribution tensions. Family inheritance systems can shift between a ""customary"" mode and a ""local Muslim"" one through family land availability tensions. Our results show that both agro-ecological and socio-economic characteristics determine the simulated family type distribution and consequently the allocation of resources. Results from simulations with no evolution processes show that villages specialize themselves on different economic activities according to natural resources: An intensification gradient is observed from the most favored site, with more local productions and improved ecological indicators, to the less-favored one, with a growing proportion of the population wealth coming from migration remittances and ""off-shore"" livestock. Once introducing such processes, the differentiation also occurs within the population level, subdividing it into specializing groups according to their size, their assets and their social status. Emerging individualistic family types increase the village populations' robustness through different and site-specific evolutions."

This paper describes an approach aimed to distributing RePast models, with minimal changes, over a networked context so as to address very large and reconfigurable models whose computational needs (in space and time) can be difficult to satisfy on a single machine. Novel in the approach is an exploitation of a lean actor infrastructure implemented in Java. Actors bring to RePast agents migration, location-transparent naming, efficient communications, and a control-centric framework. Actors can be orchestrated by an in-thelarge custom control structure which can ensure the necessary message precedence constraints. Preliminary experience is being carried out using HLA/RTI as middleware. However, the realization can also work with other standard transport layers such as Java Socket and Java RMI.

The model incorporates differential income between two classes of agents, a simplified market mechanism for the purchase of housing, and a simple geographic structure of one central city and four symmetrically arranged suburbs. Agents derive utility from neighborhood racial composition, the size of their lot, private amenities that are specific to neighborhoods, and public amenities that stretch across municipalities. We find that the public-amenities term leads to a positive-feedback loop in which migration to suburbs increases the public amenities in those munic-ipalities while lowering amenities in the central city, thus sparking further migration. When the minority agents are uniformly less affluent than the majority agents, this dynamic produces disconti-nuity in segregation as measured by centralization. Such discontinuities are typical of first-order phase transitions. When minority and majority incomes overlap, significant regions appear over which there are multistable equilibria at high and low levels of segregation, along with considerable sensitivity to the initial distribution of minority agents. We discuss the implications of these findings.© 2009 Pion Ltd and its Licensors."

Experimental data illustrate that induction of the tip cell phenotype is dependent on the protein VEGF-A; however, the process of tip cell selection is not fully understood. Here we introduce a hierarchical agent-based model simulating a suggested feedback loop that links VEGF-A tip cell induction with delta-like 4 (Dll4)/notch-mediated lateral inhibition. The model identifies VEGF-A concentration, VEGF-A gradients and filopodia extension as critical parameters in determining the robustness of tip/stalk patterning. The behaviour of the model provides new mechanistic insights into the vascular patterning defects observed in pathologically high VEGF-A, such as diabetic retinopathy and tumour angiogenesis. We investigate the role of cell morphology in tip/stalk patterning, highlighting filopodia as lateral inhibition amplifiers. The model has been used to make a number of predictions, which are now being tested experimentally, including: (1) levels of Dll4/VEGFR-2, or related downstream proteins, oscillate in synchrony along a vessel in high VEGF environments; (2) a VEGF gradient increases tip cell selection rate. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

One such calculus, called APi-calculus (an extension to Pi-calculus), provides extensive support for modeling migration, intelligence, natural grouping and security in agent-based systems [18]. In this article, a visualization tool for APi-calculus is proposed. Although an invaluable formal method for mobile agent systems, APi-calculus is quite complex (as are other calculi) and not very well suited to working with practical applications by itself. Due to the dynamic nature of mobile agents, a graphical program based on the mathematics of the calculus would enhance the use of the calculus and its attraction to the mobile agents industry. The ability to provide instant demonstration of a designed system to the user and the support for verification and validation of such systems specified by the calculus would prove to be a great asset for APi-calculus as well as agents-based computing in general. This paper presents ACVisualizer, a visualization software for APi-calculus, which provides such high level support for modeling mobile agent systems. Due to the backward compatibility of APi-calculus with Pi-calculus, ACVisualizer can easily be adapted to work with Pi-calculus itself. © 2008 - IOS Press and the authors."

Although it can be observed experimentally, we lack the tools to explore many biological rules that govern NHK self-organization. An agent-based computational model was developed, based on rules derived from literature, which predicts the dynamic multicellular morphogenesis of NHK and of a keratinocyte cell line (HaCat cells) under varying extracellular Ca++ concentrations. The model enables in virtuo exploration of the relative importance of biological rules and was used to test hypotheses in virtuo which were subsequently examined in vitro. Results indicated that cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesions were critically important to NHK self-organization. In contrast, cell cycle length and the number of divisions that transit-amplifying cells could undergo proved non-critical to the final organization. Two further hypotheses, to explain the growth behaviour of HaCat cells, were explored in virtuo-an inability to differentiate and a differing sensitivity to extracellular calcium. In vitro experimentation provided some support for both hypotheses. For NHKs, the prediction was made that the position of stem cells would influence the pattern of cell migration post-wounding.

Primary human alveolar type II cells in 3D cultures have been shown to undergo processes of cell migration and aggregation to form hollow cystic structures that resemble human lung alveoli. Although various molecular factors that mediate alveolization have been identified, little is known about biological principles that drive the morphogenic processes. To help elucidate the operating principles governing the morphogenic behavior of pulmonary epithelial cells, we have developed an agent-based model of alveolar cells in culture. The model system comprises discrete components that represent individual cells and different elements of the extracellular environment. Individual cells are represented as independent agents that act based on a set of axioms (principles) that govern their interaction with the surroundings. Simulation of alveolar cell cultures confirms that the model is capable of generating phenotypic attributes similar to those of in vitro observations. Based on the results, we hypothesize that the axioms governing simulated cell behavior have in vitro counterparts. Further interrogation and refinement of the model is expected to help unravel the causal linkages between the operating principles of cell behavior and observed systemic phenotypes."

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently overexpressed in many cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In silico modeling is considered to be an increasingly promising tool to add useful insights into the dynamics of the EGFR signal transduction pathway. However, most of the previous modeling work focused on the molecular or the cellular level only, neglecting the crucial feedback between these scales as well as the interaction with the heterogeneous biochemical microenvironment. Results. We developed a multiscale model for investigating expansion dynamics of NSCLC within a two-dimensional in silico microenvironment. At the molecular level, a specific EGFR-ERK intracellular signal transduction pathway was implemented. Dynamical alterations of these molecules were used to trigger phenotypic changes at the cellular level. Examining the relationship between extrinsic ligand concentrations, intrinsic molecular profiles and microscopic patterns, the results confirmed that increasing the amount of available growth factor leads to a spatially more aggressive cancer system. Moreover, for the cell closest to nutrient abundance, a phase-transition emerges where a minimal increase in extrinsic ligand abolishes the proliferative phenotype altogether. Conclusion. Our in silico results indicate that in NSCLC, in the presence of a strong extrinsic chemotactic stimulus (and depending on the cell's location) downstream EGFR-ERK signaling may be processed more efficiently, thereby yielding a migration-dominant cell phenotype and overall, an accelerated spatio-temporal expansion rate. © 2007 Wang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

In the ideal case emergent properties on the tissue scale can be derived from the cellular scale. However, this has been achieved in rare examples only, in particular, when involving high-speed migration of cells. One major difficulty is the lack of a suitable multiscale simulation platform, which embeds reaction diffusion of soluble substances, fast cell migration and mechanics, and, being of great importance in several tissue types, cell flow homeostasis. In this paper a step into this direction is presented by developing an agent-based mathematical model specifically designed to incorporate these features with special emphasis on high-speed cell migration. Cells are represented as elastic spheres migrating on a substrate in lattice-free space. Their movement is regulated and guided by chemoattractants that can be derived from the substrate. The diffusion of chemoattractants is considered to be slower than cell migration and, thus, to be far from equilibrium. Tissue homeostasis is not achieved by the balance of growth and death but by a flow equilibrium of cells migrating in and out of the tissue under consideration. In this sense the number and the distribution of the cells in the tissue is a result of the model and not part of the assumptions. For the purposes of demonstration of the model properties and functioning, the model is applied to a prominent example of tissue in a cellular flow equilibrium, the secondary lymphoid tissue. The experimental data on cell speed distributions in these tissues can be reproduced using reasonable mechanical parameters for the simulated cell migration in dense tissue. © 2007 The American Physical Society."

Macquart-Moulin & Ribera Maycas (1995) reported that the six most abundant species on western and southern European shelves are all strong diel migrators. Published daytime epibenthic sledge (sled) data from the surf zone to the shelf edge matched with published behavioural data on the most abundant species were used to test, confirm and extend that relationship to other coastal regions and to identify an association of abundant migrators with species that are important in fish diets. They also reveal another pattern: a correspondence between abundant surf-zone species and species that dominate estuarine faunas seasonally. Population concentrations at estuary mouths, sills of fjords and in the surf zone suggest a lifestyle dependent upon horizontal fluxes. Marine mysids that migrate between habitats are chronically undersampled in the field, however, and are underrepresented in food-web models. Unfortunately, no single methodology samples both pelagic and benthic individuals well and nearly all shelf measurements so far reported must be considered underestimates of local abundance. Mysids are major dietary components for many benthic and pelagic fishes, mammals, cephalopods and decapods, often for key life stages, and often because mysid migrations result in encounters with predators. Mysids can be extraordinarily omnivorous, with demonstrated capabilities to digest cellulose and diets spanning macrophyte detritus, more labile detritus, large microalgae, and smaller animals and heterotrophic protists. They can be sufficiently abundant and active to play roles in sediment transport. Contributing factors to their underappreciation have been the lack of fidelity of mysids to single habitats, coupled with higher fidelity of investigators to the study of single habitats. Sampling with classical methods has been problematic because of effective evasion by mysids, compounded by extreme patchiness associated with mysid schooling. Their frequent absence from coastal and even estuarine food-web models has not been more conspicuous because the combination of their migration and omnivory spreads their feeding impacts and because they are subsidised by horizontally imported plankton and seston and are themselves horizontally exported in the form of predator gut contents and biomass. They clearly link pelagic and benthic food webs in two important and ecosystem-stabilising ways, however, by feeding in both habitats and by succumbing in both habitats to both cruising and sitand-wait predators. Consideration of resource and predation gradients and limited data implicate horizontal, diel migrations as well, extending these linkages, especially in the onshore-offshore direction. Somewhat paradoxically, the same features that have made them difficult to study by classical means, in particular schooling, diet breadth, ontogenetic change in diet and migration between habitats, suit migrating mysids well to new, individual- or agent-based modelling approaches. Moreover, benthic observatories deploying acoustic technologies with spatial and temporal resolution sufficient to resolve individual migratory behaviours promise powerful tests of such models."

Here, we present a novel three-dimensional multiscale agent-based model to simulate this cellular decision process in the context of a virtual brain tumor. Each tumor cell is equipped with an EGFR gene-protein interaction network module that also connects to a simplified cell cycle description. The simulation results show that over time proliferative and migratory cell populations not only oscillate but also directly impact the spatio-temporal expansion patterns of the entire cancer system. The percentage change in the concentration of the sub-cellular interaction network's molecular components fluctuates, and, for the 'proliferation-to-migration' switch we find that the phenotype triggering molecular profile to some degree varies as the tumor system grows and the microenvironment changes.

Folkman and colleagues (2) first identified a soluble growth-factor referred to as tumor-angiogenesis factor (TAF) produced by tumors that could induce the growth of such new capillaries. This in turn led to the concept of antiangiogenesis as tumor therapy (3). Experimental verification of this mechanism in a rabbit model (4), research discovering details of the cellular processes of tumor angiogenesis (5), and in vivo inhibition of tumor-induced angiogenesis (6) form the basis of most of the work that followed. In parallel to the experimental work, attempts were being made early on to mathematically model the endothelial cell (EC) sprouting, the interconnection and looping of blood vessels, and their growth toward the tumor induced by TAFs (7). Meanwhile, a model of the extravascular transport of reporter molecules in tumor and normal tissue showed a good fit to one-dimensional diffusion. Furthermore, real tumors were found to provide fewer hindrances to macromolecular transport by diffusion than were surrounding tissue (8).Modeling work that compared experimentally measured TAF profiles predicted that this factor could be secreted outside the neoplasm only after the tumor exceeds a threshold size (9). Patterns of angiogenesis have been examined subsequently using reaction diffusion simulations that focused (for example) on TAF diffusion (10). Furthermore, work by Byrne and Chaplain (11) examined the role of the migration rate of newly sprouted capillaries and its consequences on brush borders and the parameters contributing to successful vascularization of tumors. © Cambridge University Press 2007 and 2009."

Modelling the spatio-temporal behaviour of individuals requires new representational forms that capture how organisms store and use spatial information. New procedures must be developed that simulate how individuals produce bounded knowledge of geographical space through experiential learning, adapt this knowledge to continually changing environments, and apply it to spatial decision-making processes. In this paper, we present a framework for the representation of adaptive, spatially aware, and mobile agents. To provide context to this research, a multiagent model is constructed to simulate the migratory behaviour of elk (Cervus elaphus) on Yellowstone's northern range. In this simulated environment, intelligent agents learn in ways that enable them to mimic real-world behaviours and adapt to changing landscapes."

In silico hypothesis testing indicated that cell-cell contact, cell-substrate contact, and differentiation of transit amplifying (TA) cells were major mechanisms, whereas cell cycle times of both stem and TA cells had no obvious effects on the pattern of NHK distribution. The model suggested that the limited divisional capability of TA cells wasn't an internal cell property but a statistical phenomenon. By deliberately omitting the rules for the stem cell colony autoregulation and for cell differentiation mechanism, the population growth of a transformed keratinocyte cell line (HaCat cells) was also successfully described. The model of NHKs was then used in a predictive sense. Simulation of scratch wounds made to NHK cells indicated that wound healing in low [Ca2+] media would be achieved mainly by migration and subsequent proliferation. In physiological [Ca2+] media, a stem cell position dependent wound closure pattern was predicted. Both were then validated by in vitro experiments designed to check the model's predictions. This work demonstrates that an agent-based model, incorporating rules relating to relatively few mechanisms, is sufficient to describe, explain and predict some biological phenomena seen when keratinocytes and transformed keratinocytes are cultured in vitro."

Italy adds to this picture a very low labour market participation of the elders, so that most projections of the impact of ageing on the labour market are rather pessimistic. However, there are other long run modifications currently underway that will presumably have a sizeable impact on the labour market, above all changes in the retirement legislation, in educational choices and participation behaviour. In this paper we present LABORsim, an agent based microsimulation model of labour supply, which offers new insights on the likely evolution of the labour force in the next decades in Italy. LABORsim integrates the current demographic projections with simulation modules modelling retirement rules, retirement behaviours, migrations, education and participation choices, plus a consolle to implement various policy scenario analyses. When all these factors are taken into account, projections for next decades are not that pessimistic. In most scenarios, the overall participation rate is expected to increase steadily for the next two decades, while shortages in the labour force supply and an unfavourable dynamics for the economic dependency rate are expected to show up only after 2020, when the baby boom generations will arrive at their retirement ages. This is not enough, however, to allow Italy to meet the EU Stockholm and Lisbon targets for male and female employment rates for many decades to come. The sharp increase in the participation rates for the elderly (aged 55-64), mainly driven by the recent changes in the retirement eligibility criteria, will make it possible to meet the Stockholm target of 50% employment rate in this age group by 2015, i.e. with only 5 years of delay. © Springer 2006."

We model the heterogeneous cell population as a mixture of two distinct genotypes: the more proliferative Type A and the more migratory Type B. Our agent-based simulations reveal a phase transition in the tumor's velocity of spatial expansion linking the tumor fitness to genotypic composition. Specifically, velocity initially falls as rising payoffs reward the interactions among the more stationary Type A cells, but unexpectedly accelerates again when these A-A payoffs increase even further. At this latter accelerating stage, fewer migratory Type B cells appear to confer a competitive advantage in terms of the tumor's spatial aggression over the overall numerically dominating Type A cells, which in turn leads to an acceleration of the overall tumor dynamics while its surface roughness declines.

Here, we present a novel computational model simulating this cellular decision-process leading up to either phenotype based on a molecular interaction network of genes and proteins. The model's regulatory network consists of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), its ligand transforming growth factor-α (TGFα), the downstream enzyme phospholipaseC-γ (PLCγ) and a mitosis-associated response pathway. This network is activated by autocrine TGFα secretion, and the EGFR-dependent downstream signaling this step triggers, as well as modulated by an extrinsic nutritive glucose gradient. Employing a framework of mass action kinetics within a multiscale agent-based environment, we analyse both the emergent multicellular behavior of tumor growth and the single-cell molecular profiles that change over time and space. Our results show that one can indeed simulate the dichotomy between cell migration and proliferation based solely on an EGFR decision network. It turns out that these behavioral decisions on the single cell level impact the spatial dynamics of the entire cancerous system. Furthermore, the simulation results yield intriguing experimentally testable hypotheses also on the sub-cellular level such as spatial cytosolic polarization of PLCγ towards an extrinsic chemotactic gradient.

Computational models of the behavior of epithelial cells in monolayer cell culture have been developed and used to predict the healing characteristics of scratch wounds made to urothelial cell cultures maintained in low- and physiological [Ca2+] environments. Both computational models and in vitro experiments demonstrated that in low exogenous [Ca2+], the closure of 500-μm scratch wounds was achieved primarily by cell migration into the denuded area. The wound healing rate in low (0.09 mM) [Ca2+] was approximately twice as rapid as in physiological (2 mM) [Ca2+]. Computational modeling predicted that in cell cultures that are actively proliferating, no increase in the fraction of cells in the S-phase would be expected, and this conclusion was supported experimentally in vitro by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assay. We have demonstrated that a simple rule-based model of cell behavior, incorporating rules relating to contact inhibition of proliferation and migration, is sufficient to qualitatively predict the calcium-dependent pattern of wound closure observed in vitro. Differences between the in vitro and in silico models suggest a role for wound-induced signaling events in urothelial cell cultures."

The MameLuke framework enhances the understanding of the relationship between societal processes and LUCC by modelling individual and group decisions and human-environment interactions.The framework allows for the transformation of real-life stories into computerised models following a predetermined sequence. By doing so, the framework allows for a truly integrative approach, because it is not bound to any particular scientific discourse. Even better, the framework enables its users to combine scientific discourses regarding human decisions and behaviour on multiple scales and levels.The agents (actors and locations) in the framework are heterogeneous. This heterogeneity of agent behaviour is established by dividing the agents into categories. If an agent is a member of an agent category or combination of categories, it has access to a defined set of implementable actions. The actions are constructed out of potential option paths (POPs) and potential option nodes (PONs). The whole of POPs represent a theoretical construct of agent behaviour and decisions that the framework user wishes to explore. The POP defines a sequence of PONs. The PON is a transaction interface between an initialising agent and a recipient agent where they exchange material and immaterial capital.This paper explains the basic architecture of the MameLuke framework and shows its applicability with a model of a Philippine case study. This case study concerns the dynamics of migration and deforestation. It is part of a larger study on land use change in the San Mariano watershed area at the forest fringe of the Sierra Madre mountains in the Philippines. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

To date, methodological difficulties have probably prevented this union. However, new modeling techniques that could help are available. This paper presents the construction and application of an agent-based simulation model of skylarks in agricultural landscapes and its use to assess the impact of pesticides relative to changes in landscape structure and mortality assumptions. Simulations indicated that pesticides had a negative impact on skylark population size. The annual reduction in numbers was variable and depended primarily upon migration mortality and an interaction between weather and pesticides. Altering landscape structure, crop diversity, or migration mortality assumptions resulted in a population change of approximately 37%, compared to a mean of 4% for pesticides. It was concluded that factors other than pesticides are likely to be limiting skylark numbers in most landscapes. This study demonstrates the importance of modeling the interactions between spatio-temporal environmental factors and the study organisms. Agent-based models (ABMs) are able to extract these relationships as emergent properties of their mechanistic nature. Therefore, we recommend the use of ABM models in future regulatory assessment of pesticides."

Very little is known, however, about the existence of structure-function relationships in these types of neoplasm. Therefore, using a previously developed two-dimensional agent-based model, we have investigated the emergent patterns of multiple tumor cells that proliferate and migrate on an adaptive grid lattice, driven by a local-search mechanism and guided by the presence of distinct environmental conditions. Numerical results indicate a strong correlation between the fractal dimensions of the tumor surface and the average velocity of the tumor's spatial expansion. In particular, when the so called 'beaten-path advantage' intensifies, i.e., rising 'mechanical rewards' for cells to follow each other along preformed pathways, it results in an increase of the tumor system's fractal dimensions leading to a concomitant acceleration of its spatial expansion. Whereas cell migration is the dominant phenotype responsible for the more extensive branching patterns exhibiting higher fractal dimensions, cell proliferation appears to become more active primarily at lower fracticality associated with stronger mechanical confinements. Implications of these results for experimental and clinical cancer research are discussed. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The agents in the model represent individuals in the five East German states who decide whether or not, when and whereto in the West to migrate. Agents respond to incentives provided by current and expected future unemployment and income differentials between states, moving costs and job search costs. Consistent with recent empirical evidence the simulation results show that agents who experience unemployment are more likely to emigrate. The large number of emigrants in the periods after the fall of the wall can be explained by an (initially) large number of very mobile individuals (e.g., young Easterners). Moreover, the predictions show that geographic proximity and the demand for technically skilled labor explain most of the observed distribution of migrants across west German states."

The current paper considers this approach with respect to householder migration and dynamics of residential distribution. It begins with a characterization of different styles of AB modelling and proceeds with examples of AB models of residential behavior, ranging from Schelling-type abstract models to real-world simulations of the population dynamics of an urban region with a population of 30,000. The latter is investigated in depth."

If an agent finds that the service roundtrip time (RTT) is too long, then it may try to cut it down by migrating to another idle node. Since migration is an expensive activity, the agent should decide correctly before making the move. One way of achieving sound decision making is to measure the mean RTT of the channel and to ensure that the RTT up-trend is not a transient phenomenon. The M3RT works on past history accumulated since the commencement of the channel operation. It never has computation overflow because of it integral nature. In the M3RT development process the corresponding time/stochastic Petri net model was built for exhaustive verification. The aim is to ensure that convergence stability exists under all conditions. The input waveforms used in the simulations mimic the dynamic reality of a sizeable network such as the Internet. Preliminary and limited validation tests in a controlled environment indicate that the M3RT works equally well as its macro predecessor, namely, the stable M2RT (Mean Message Roundtrip Time) package. © 2002 IEEE."

Therefore mobile agent (MA) based solutions were presented to enhance the efficiency of network management tasks. The paper investigates the existing MA delegation schemes and migration policies, and proposes a solution for effective agent deployment using dynamic agent domains. The size of the domains is altered during the trading process, where agents exchange nodes in order to equalize their workload using a lightweight communication model. Cloning and merging operations can be initiated to modify the number of agents, providing adaptivity to changing network conditions. The presented method includes the population and load control for network management agents along with robustness and fault tolerance mechanisms to achieve a guaranteed visiting frequency for the managed hosts. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2001."
